Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.11,4.53,"This class is divided into
three subclasses, three parts."
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,4.53,6.01,They are supervised learning.
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,6.01,7.67,">> Yeah.
>> Unsupervised learning,"
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,7.67,8.47,and reinforcement.
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,9.54,12.145,"So, what do you think
supervised learning is?"
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,12.145,17.509999999999998,">> So, I think of supervised learning
as being the problem of taking labelled"
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,17.51,23.057000000000002,"data sets, gleaning information from
it so that you can label new data sets."
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,23.057,24.137999999999998,>> That's fair.
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,24.138,26.355,I call that function approximation.
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,26.355,28.798000000000002,"So, here's an example
of supervised learning."
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,28.798,31.342,"I'm going to give you an input and
an output."
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,31.342,32.912,"And I'm going to give
them to you as pairs, and"
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,32.912,34.36,"I want you to guess
what the function is."
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,34.36,35.441,">> Sure.
>> Okay?"
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,35.441,36.185,Okay.
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,36.185,36.845,"1, 1."
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,36.845,37.925,>> Uh-huh.
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,37.925,38.784,"2, 4."
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,38.784,40.92,">> Wait, hang on,
is 1 the input and 1 the output,."
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,40.92,42.84,">> Yes.
>> And 2 the input, and 4 the output?"
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,42.84,44.057,">> Correct.
>> All right."
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,44.057,45.82,"I'm on, I think I am on to you."
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,45.82,46.44,">> 3, 9."
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,46.44,47.628,">> Okay.
>> 4, 16."
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,47.628,48.383,>> Nice.
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,48.383,49.148,">> 5, 25."
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,49.148,50.426,"6, 36."
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,50.426,51.446000000000005,"7, 49."
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,51.446,52.666,>> Nice.
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,52.666,53.503,This is a very hip data set.
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,53.503,54.349,>> It is.
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,54.349,56.01,"What's the function?
>> It's hip to be squared."
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,56.01,57.199999999999996,>> Exactly.
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,57.2,58.49,Maybe.
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,58.49,59.660000000000004,"So if you believe that's true,"
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,59.66,62.15,"then tell me if the input is 10,
what's the output?"
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,62.15,64.519,">> 100.
>> And that's right, if it turns out,"
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,64.519,66.88000000000001,"in fact, that the function is x squared."
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,66.88,69.92,"But the truth is, we have no idea
whether this function is x squared."
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,69.92,71.8,"Not really.
>> I have a pretty good idea."
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,71.8,72.36,">> You do?
>> Well-"
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,72.36,73.76,>> Where's that idea come from?
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,73.76,77.07000000000001,">> It comes from having spoken with
you over a long period of time."
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,78.52,79.99,"And plus, you know, math."
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,79.99,80.97,>> And plus math.
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,80.97,82.42999999999999,"Well, I'm going to-"
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,82.43,83.10000000000001,>> You can't say I'm wrong.
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,83.1,84.22999999999999,>> You're wrong.
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,84.23,85.06,">> Oh.
>> Yeah, I did."
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,85.06,85.91,>> You just said I was wrong.
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,85.91,88.33,">> No, you've talked to me for
a long time, and plus math."
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,88.33,89.28,I agree with that.
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,89.28,90.28,">> Okay.
>> But"
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,90.28,92.51,"I'm going to claim that you're
making a leap of faith."
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,92.51,94.11,">> Hm.
>> Despite being a scientist,"
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,94.11,97.019,"by deciding that the input is 10 and
the output is 100."
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,98.12,99.25,">> Sure.
I would agree with that."
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,99.25,100.562,>> What's that leap of faith?
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,100.562,104.90299999999999,">> Well, I mean, from what you told me,
it's still consistent with lots of"
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,104.903,108.84,"other mappings from input to
output like 10 gets mapped to 11."
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,108.84,111.046,">> Right or
everything is x squared except 10."
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,111.046,111.60300000000001,>> Sure.
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,111.603,113.344,">> Or everything is x,
x squared up to 10."
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,113.344,114.365,">> Right, that would be mean-"
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,114.365,115.446,>> That would be mean-
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,115.446,117.80199999999999,>> But it's not logically impossible.
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,117.802,119.161,>> What would be the median?
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,119.161,120.1,>> A-ha.
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,120.1,120.72699999999999,>> Thank you very much.
Ki2iHgKxRBo,Supervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,120.727,121.955,"I, I was saving that one up."
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.21,3.06,"Well, what you're doing in order to make
that work and what you end up doing in"
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,3.06,5.16,"supervised learning and
functions approximation in general,"
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,5.16,7.92,"is you make some fundamental
assumptions about the work, right?"
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,7.92,11.56,"You decide that you have a well-behaved
function that is consistent with"
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,11.56,15.48,"the data that you're given, and with
that, you're able to generalize, and"
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,15.48,18.12,"in fact that is the fundamental
problem in machine learning."
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,18.12,19.76,It is generalization.
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,19.76,23.055,"Now what's behind all of is
I'm going to claim, Michael,"
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,23.055,27.03,"you jump in whenever you disagree is
>> I disagree sorry to soon, go ahead."
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,27.03,28.52,>> is bias and in particular
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,28.52,29.652,">> bias
>> inductive bias."
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,29.652,30.496000000000002,>> Inductive bias.
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,30.496,32.595,">> Right, so all of machine learning or"
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,32.595,37.36,"certainly supervised learning is about
induction, as opposed to deduction."
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,37.36,39.07,">> I see.
Induction of course being a problem of"
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,39.07,41.82,"going from examples to
a more general rule."
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,41.82,44.7,">> Right, specifics to generalities."
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,44.7,46.160000000000004,"By contrast, deduction is?"
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,47.73,48.25,>> Be the opposite.
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,48.25,51.3,"It would be going from a general
rule to specific instances,"
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,51.3,53.29,basically like reasoning.
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,53.29,54.19,">> Right, and in fact,"
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,54.19,56.9,"a lot of AI in the beginning
was about deductive reasoning,"
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,56.9,60.199999999999996,"about logic programming, those sorts of
things, where you have certain rules,"
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,60.2,63.400000000000006,"and you deduce only those things that
follow immediately from those rules."
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,63.4,66.03,"So for example,
you'd have something like A implies B."
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,66.03,68.2,That's a rule in the universe.
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,68.2,69.65,And then I tell you A.
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,69.65,72.54,"So if you A implies B is a rule in
the universe, and I tell you A,"
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,72.54,74.54,then you also know?
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,74.54,76.31,>> That A implies B.
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,76.31,77.93,>> And therefore you can infer that?
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,77.93,78.48,>> And A. B. >> B.
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,78.48,83.27000000000001,"You have A implies B,
you have A, that implies B."
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,83.27,86.89,">> Okay.
>> That's what we just said."
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,88.23,89.04,"But what,
>> that's deduction."
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,89.04,91.68,">> That's deduction, but
we just did was not deduction."
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,91.68,95.48,"Before then when I asked you one, one,
two, four, three, nine, four sixteen and"
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,95.48,96.23,so forth.
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,96.23,97.31,">> Right,
>> we did induction."
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,97.31,98.09,>> That was induction.
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,98.09,101.9,">> Induction is more about
did the sun rise yesterday?"
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,101.9,103.61,">> yes.
>> Did the sun rise the day before that?"
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,103.61,105.09,">> yes.
>> Did the sun rise the day before that?"
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,106.88,108.08,>> I slept in.
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,108.08,109.25,Did the sun rise the day before that?
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,109.25,109.86,>> Yes.
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,109.86,110.36,>> Yes.
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,110.36,111.52,So the sun has risen every day.
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,111.52,112.81,Is the sun going to rise tomorrow?
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,113.87,114.74000000000001,>> I sure hope so.
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,114.74,117.03,">> We all hope so, and
we all act like it does,"
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,117.03,120.01,"because if it doesn't, then there are a
whole bunch of other things we ought to"
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,120.01,122.29,"be doing besides sitting in this
studio and having this interview."
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,122.29,123.48100000000001,>> I think we should warn the plants.
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,123.481,125.701,">> [LAUGH] I don't think
the plants are going to care."
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,125.701,127.05,">> They are.
They really need sun."
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,127.05,129.389,"I think we all need sun, Mike."
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,129.389,131.20000000000002,">> Eh.
>> So, the idea there is"
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,131.2,134.31,"induction is crucial, and
the inductive bias is crucial."
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,134.31,136.65,"We'll talk about all of this in,
in the course."
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,136.65,137.68,">> Kay.
>> But that's kind of a fundamental"
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,137.68,139.93,"notion behind supervised learning and
machine learning in general."
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,139.93,140.5,>> I agree with that.
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,140.5,141.11,">> Agreed?
>> Yeah."
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,141.11,142.08,">> Al lright, so we're on the same page."
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,142.08,143.26000000000002,So that's supervised learning.
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,143.26,145.82,"Supervised learning, you can talk about
it in these high muckity muck ways, but"
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,145.82,147.98999999999998,"at the end of the day,
it's function approximation."
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,147.99,150.09,"It's figuring out how to take
a bunch of training examples and"
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,150.09,153.05,"coming up with some function
that generalizes beyond"
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,153.05,153.66000000000003,the data that you see.
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,153.66,155.59,">> So, why wouldn't you call
it function induction, then?"
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,157.175,158.77,">> because someone said
supervised learning first."
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,158.77,159.28,"Well, there is a-"
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,159.28,159.85,">> No, no, no, no, no.
Sorry."
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,159.85,163.297,"You said supervised learning is function
approximation and I want to say,"
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,163.297,166.68,"why don't you say supervised
learning is function induction."
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,166.68,168.21,>> As opposed to function approximation?
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,168.21,168.96,>> Yeah.
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,168.96,169.47,>> Okay.
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,169.47,171.84,"It's a

pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,173.23,175.35299999999998,">> Or induction of approximate, of."
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,175.353,176.061,>> Approximate functions?
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,176.061,176.96,">> Approximate functions,
something like that, yeah."
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,176.96,179.16,">> You don't want to induce
an approximate function,"
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,179.16,180.6,you want to induce the actual function.
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,180.6,181.97,">> Yeah, but sometimes you can't,
>> Yeah."
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,181.97,186.254,">> Because sometimes you think
it's quadratic, but it's not."
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,186.254,187.89999999999998,>> I have that as a plaque on my wall.
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,187.9,189.37,>> You do?
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,189.37,189.96200000000002,>> No.
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,189.962,190.682,>> Yeah I didn't think so.
pqXASFHUfhs,Induction and Deduction - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,190.682,191.97,Okay so that's supervised learning
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.09,2.42,What about unsupervised learning?
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,2.42,4.939,">> Right, so unsupervised learning
we don't get those examples."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,4.939,7.75,"We have just essentially
something like input, and"
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,7.75,11.72,"we have to derive some structure
from them just by looking at"
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,11.72,13.595,"the relationship between
the inputs themselves."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,13.595,17.669,>> Right so give me an example of that.
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,17.669,18.28,>> So.
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,21.06,25.445,"When you're studying different kinds
of animals, say, even as a kid."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,25.445,27.54,">> Mm-hm.
>> You might start to say, oh,"
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,27.54,29.31,"there's these animals that
all look kind of the same."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,29.31,30.27,They're all four-legged.
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,30.27,32.019999999999996,I'm going to call all of them dogs.
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,32.02,34.050000000000004,"Even if they happen to be horses,
or cows, or whatever."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,34.05,36.41,"But I have developed,
without anyone telling me,"
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,36.41,39.029999999999994,"this sort of notion that all
these belong in the same class."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,39.03,40.339,"And it's different
from things like trees."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,41.34,42.7,Which don't have four legs.
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,42.7,46.34,">> Well some do, but I mean, they have,
they both bark, is all I'm saying."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,47.9,48.99,>> Did I really set you up for that?
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,48.99,49.870000000000005,>> Not on purpose.
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,49.87,51.879999999999995,">> I, I'm sorry, I want to apologize
to each and every one of you for that."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,51.88,53.18,But that was pretty good.
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,53.18,54.58,Michael is very good at word play.
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,54.58,56.67,"Which I guess is often
unsupervised as well."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,57.69,58.870999999999995,"No, I get a lot of [LAUGH]."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,58.871,61.06,">> [LAUGH] You certainly
get a lot of feedback."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,61.06,61.64,">> Yeah, that's right."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,61.64,63.52,"So I say, please stop doing that."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,63.52,66.96000000000001,">> So if supervised learning is
about function approximation,"
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,66.96,69.53999999999999,"then unsupervised learning
is about description."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,69.54,71.36,It's about taking a set of data and
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,71.36,74.16,"figuring out how you might divide
it up in one way or the other."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,74.16,76.47,">> Or maybe even summarization
it's not just the description but"
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,76.47,77.42999999999999,it's a shorter description.
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,77.43,78.97000000000001,">> Yeah, it's usually concise."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,78.97,80.51,Compression.
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,80.51,81.85000000000001,>> Compact description.
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,81.85,85.35499999999999,"So I might take a bunch of pixels
like I have here it might say, male."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,85.355,86.81,">> [LAUGH] Wait, wait, wait, wait."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,86.81,87.59,I'm pixels now?
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,88.76,89.57000000000001,>> As far as we can tell.
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,89.57,90.61999999999999,>> That's fine.
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,90.62,91.56,">> I however, am not pixels."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,91.56,92.44,I know I'm not pixels.
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,92.44,93.56,"I'm pretty sure the rest
of you are pixels."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,93.56,94.77,">> That's right.
>> So I have a bunch of pixels, and"
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,94.77,96.252,I might say male.
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,96.252,97.75,And or I might say female.
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,97.75,98.97,Or I might say dog.
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,98.97,100.16,Or I might say tree.
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,100.16,103.03,"But, the point is I don't have a bunch
of labels that say dog, tree, male,"
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,103.03,103.55,or female.
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,103.55,107.78999999999999,"I just decide that pixels like
this belong with pixels like this."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,107.79,110.98,"As opposed to pixels like something
else that I'm pointing to behind me."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,110.98,113.88000000000001,">> Yeah we're living in a world right
now that is devoid of any other objects."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,113.88,114.66,"Oh, chairs!"
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,114.66,115.39999999999999,">> Chairs!
Right."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,115.4,118.94000000000001,"So these pixels are very different
than those pixels because of"
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,118.94,120.87,"where they are relative
to the other pixels."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,120.87,122.17,"Say, right?"
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,122.17,122.96000000000001,"So, if you were looking-"
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,122.96,125.25,">> I'm not sure that's helping me
understand unsupervised learning."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,125.25,126.19,">> Go out and, go outside and"
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,126.19,130.19,"look at a crowd of people and try to
decide how you might divide them up."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,130.19,131.82999999999998,"Maybe you'll divide
them up by ethnicity."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,131.83,135.84,"Maybe you'll divide them up by
whether they have purposefully shaven"

1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,145.492,147.01999999999998,"there's lots of things that
you might do in order,."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,147.02,148.56,">> Did you just point at me and
say grey hair?"
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,148.56,150.3,">> I was pointing and
your head happened to be there."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,150.3,150.97,">> Oh come on.
>> Pixels,"
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,150.97,151.51,>> Where's the grey hair?
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,151.51,155.361,">> It's a two dimensional, right there,
it's right where your spit curl is."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,156.44,157.12,All right.
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,157.12,158.64000000000001,">> Okay.
So, imagine you're dividing the world"
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,158.64,159.39,up that way.
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,159.39,160.70999999999998,"You could divide it up male, female."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,160.71,163.48600000000002,"You could divide it up short, tall,
wears hats, doesn't wear hats,"
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,163.486,164.98,all kinds of ways you can divide it up.
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,164.98,167.75,"And no one's telling you the right way
to divide it up, at least not directly."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,167.75,168.69,That's unsupervised learning.
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,168.69,170.1,"That's description, because now-"
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,170.1,172.635,">> Mm.
>> Rather than having to send pixels of"
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,172.635,176.786,"everyone, or having to do a complete
description of this crowd,"
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,176.786,180.264,"you can say there were 57 males and
23 females say."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,180.264,182.888,Or there are mostly people with beards.
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,182.888,184.071,">> So on.
>> Or whatever."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,184.071,185.105,>> I like summarization for that.
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,185.105,185.65099999999998,That seems good.
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,185.651,186.233,>> I like summarization for that.
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,186.233,187.489,">> Yeah.
>> It's a nice concise description."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,187.489,188.266,That's unsupervised learning.
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,188.266,189.165,">> Good.
Very good."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,189.165,189.849,">> And practice.
>> And that's different from"
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,189.849,190.41,supervised learning?
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,190.41,193.63,">> It's different in supervised learning
and it's different in a couple of ways."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,193.63,196.4,"One way that it's different
is all of those ways that we"
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,196.4,198.6,could have just divided up the world.
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,198.6,201.53,In some sense are all equal either.
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,201.53,203.78,So I could divide up by sex or
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,203.78,207.66,"I could divide up by height or I could
divide up by clothing or whatever."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,207.66,211.7,"And they're all equally good absent
some other signal later telling you"
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,211.7,213.17,how you should be dividing up the world.
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,213.17,216.92,"But supervised learning directly
tells you there's a signal."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,216.92,218.92499999999998,"This is what it ought to be,
and that's how you train."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,218.925,219.55,And those are very different.
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,219.55,222.42000000000002,">> Now, but I could see ways that
unsupervised learning could be helpful"
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,222.42,224.42,"in the supervised setting, right?"
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,224.42,227.66,"So if I do get a nice description, and
it's the right kind of description,"
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,227.66,230.93,"it might help me map to, it may help me
do the function approximation better."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,230.93,233.26500000000001,">> Right, so instead of taking
pixels that input, as input, and,"
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,233.265,235.10999999999999,"and labels like, male or female."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,235.11,237.871,"I could just simply take a summarization
of you like how much hair do"
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,237.871,239.892,"you have your relative height,
the weight, and"
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,239.892,241.99,"various things like that
that might help me do it."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,241.99,242.74,"That's right.
And by the way,"
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,242.74,245.49,"in practice this turns out to be
things like density estimation."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,245.49,247.91,"We do end up turning it into
statistics at the end of the day."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,249.76,250.82,Often.
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,250.82,252.01999999999998,">> But
it's statistics from the beginning."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,252.02,253.93,But when you say density estimation.
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,253.93,256.01,">> Yes.
>> Are you saying I'm stupid?"
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,258.22,258.901,"No.
>> All right so"
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,258.901,260.67,what is density estimation?
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,260.67,262.04,">> Well they'll have to
take the class to find out."
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,262.04,262.66,>> I see.
1qtfILYSDJY,Unsupervised Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,262.66,263.16,>> Okay
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.125,1.425,"All right.
So that's supervised learning and"
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,1.425,2.087,unsupervised learning.
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,2.087,2.9210000000000003,That's pretty good.
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,2.921,4.64,The last one is reinforcement learning.

Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,82.939,84.83099999999999,"So so that is what got
me interested in it, and"
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,84.831,87.144,"I was, I didn't even know what
it was called for a long time."
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,87.144,89.391,"So I started doing
reinforcement learning, and"
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,89.391,91.927,"then discovered that it was
interesting and popular."
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,91.927,93.111,>> Right.
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,93.111,95.799,"Well, I certainly wouldn't suggest that
we're doing the science that we're doing"
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,95.799,96.59200000000001,because it's popular.
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,96.592,97.951,"We're doing it because
we're interested in it."
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,97.951,98.508,>> Yes.
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,98.508,101.792,">> And I'm interested in reinforcement
learning because in some sense,"
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,101.792,104.592,"it kind of encapsulates all
the things I happen to care about."
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,104.592,108.587,"I come from a sort of general AI
background, and I care modeling people."
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,108.587,111.56700000000001,"I care about building smart agents
that have to live in in world that"

hundreds of thousand of them,"
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,114.813,115.73700000000001,thousands of them.
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,115.737,117.362,Some of them might be human and
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,117.362,120.22999999999999,"have to feel some way to
predict what to do over time."
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,120.23,123.38600000000001,"So, from a sort a technical point
of view, if we can think of re,"
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,123.386,126.545,"in, supervised learning as
function approximation and"
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,126.545,128.485,"unsupervised learning as, you know."
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,128.485,129.36200000000002,">> Concise-
>> Concise,"
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,129.362,132.076,"impact description, what's
the difference between something like"
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,132.076,133.64,reinforcement learning and those two?
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,133.64,134.464,Supervised learning.
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,134.464,137.284,">> So often the way that
supervised learning oh, sorry,"
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,137.284,141.29,"reinforcement learning is described is,
is learning from delayed reward."
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,141.29,142.969,">> Mm-hm.
So instead of the feedback that you get"
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,142.969,145.249,"in supervised learning which
is here's what you should do."
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,145.249,148.364,"And the feedback that you get in
unsupervised learning which is"
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,148.364,151.481,"the feedback in reinforcement
learning may come several steps"
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,151.481,153.968,"after the decisions that
you've actually made."
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,153.968,156.25699999999998,">> So a good example of that, or
the easy example of that would be,"
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,156.257,158.044,"actually your tic-tac-toe program,
right?"
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,158.044,162.452,"So, you do something in tic-tac-toe,
you put an X in the center and"
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,162.452,165.266,"then you put a, let's say,
an O over here."
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,165.266,165.766,>> Oh.
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,165.766,167.762,>> And then I put an X right here.
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,167.762,168.401,>> Nice.
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,168.401,171.327,">> And then you ridiculously
put an O in the center."
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,171.327,173.728,">> Which allows me to put
an X over here and I win."
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,173.728,174.309,>> All right.
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,174.309,176.219,">> Now what's interesting about that is,"
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,176.219,179.487,"I didn't tell you what happened until
the very end when I said X wins."
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,179.487,180.509,>> Right.
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,180.509,183.16099999999997,"And now I know I made a mistake
somewhere along the way but"
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,183.161,184.584,I don't know exactly where.
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,184.584,187.65,"I may have to kind of roll back the game
in my mind and eventually figure out"
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,187.65,190.389,"where it is that I went off track,
and what it is that I did wrong."
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,190.389,192.339,">> And in the full generality
of reinforcement learning,"
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,192.339,193.547,you may have never made a mistake.
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,193.547,195.65,"It may simply be that's
the way games go but"
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,195.65,198.584,"you would like to know which of
the moves you made mattered."
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,198.584,201.30700000000002,"Now, if it were a civilized learning
problem, I would have put the X here,"
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,201.307,204.004,"he would have put the O there, and
it would have been called that's Good."
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,204.004,205.727,"I would have put the X here, and"
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,205.727,209.781,"when he put the O there, it would have
been that's Bad, the O goes here."
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,209.781,210.339,>> Mm-hm.
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,210.339,211.382,"Right.
>> Or something like that."
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,211.382,213.77700000000002,"It would have told you where
he should have put the O."
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,213.777,216.059,"But here, all he gets is eventually
some kind of signal saying,"
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,216.059,216.962,you did something well.
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,216.962,219.95499999999998,"You did something poorly and even
then it's only relative to the other"
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,219.955,221.536,signals that you might have gotten.
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,221.536,224.428,">> Right, so then reinforcement
learning is in some sense harder"
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,224.428,226.4,because nobody's telling you what to do.
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,226.4,227.782,You have to work it out on your own.
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,227.782,231.62400000000002,">> Yeah it's like playing a game
without knowing any of the rules."
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,231.624,236.478,Or at least knowing how you win or lose.
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,236.478,240.342,"But being told every once in awhile that
you've won or you've lost, okay, now-"
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,240.342,241.28300000000002,>> Sometimes I feel like that.
Ee4uH7PaN1M,Reinforcement Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,241.283,243.13,>> I know man.
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.001,3.537,"Okay, so we've got these three little
bits of machine learning here."
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,3.537,6.005,"And there are a lot of tools and
techniques that are inside that."
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,6.005,7.55,">> Mm-hm.
>> And I think that's great."
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,7.55,9.87,"And we're going to be trying to
teach you a lot of those tools and"
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,9.87,11.979,"techniques and
sort of ways to connect them together."
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,11.979,13.475999999999999,"So by the way,
as Michael was pointing out,"
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,13.476,15.584000000000001,"there are kind of ways that these
things might help each other,"
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,15.584,17.585,"unsupervised learning might
help supervised learning."
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,17.585,19.080000000000002,It's actually much deeper than that.
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,19.08,21.817,"It turns out you, even though
unsupervised learning is clearly not"
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,21.817,24.507,"the same as supervised learning at
the level that we described it,"
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,24.507,26.394000000000002,"in some ways they're
exactly the same thing."
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,26.394,28.529999999999998,Supervised learning you have some bias.
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,28.53,31.232,"Oh, it's a quadratic function,
induction make sense."
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,31.232,32.92,All these kind of assumptions you make.
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,32.92,36.643,"And in unsupervised learning, I told you
that we don't know whether this clusters"
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,36.643,40.258,"is better than this cluster, dividing by
sex is better than dividing by height,"
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,40.258,41.709,"or, or hair color or whatever."
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,41.709,42.977000000000004,>> Mm.
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,42.977,46.285,">> But ultimately you make some
decision about how to cluster, and"
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,46.285,49.05,"that means implicitly
there's some assume signal."
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,49.05,50.79,"There's some assume set of labels
that you think make sense."
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,50.79,54.722,"Oh, I think things that look alike
should somehow be clustered together."
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,54.722,55.289,>> Mm.
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,55.289,57.81,">> Or things that are near one
another should cluster together."
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,57.81,59.695,"So in some ways it's still kind
of like supervised learning."
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,59.695,60.694,You can certainly turn any
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,60.694,63.481,"supervised learning problem into
an unsupervised learning problem."
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,63.481,64.031,">> Mm, mm.
>> Right?"
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,64.031,67.25,"So in fact, all of these problems
are really the same kind of problem."
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,67.25,68.536,">> Yeah, well there's two things
that I'd want to add to that."
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,68.536,70.8,"One is that in some sense,
in many cases,"
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,70.8,75.58,"you can formulate all these different
problems as some form of optimization."
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,75.58,77.77799999999999,"In supervised learning
you want something that,"
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,77.778,81.17800000000001,"that labels data well and so you're,
the thing you're trying to optimize is"
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,81.178,83.818,"find me a function that,
that does that scores it."
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,83.818,87.28999999999999,"In reinforcement learning we're trying
to find a behavior that scores well."
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,87.29,90.396,"And unsu, unsupervised learning we
usually have to make up some kind of"
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,90.396,92.982,"a criterion, and then we find
a way of clustering the data,"
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,92.982,94.929,"organizing the data so
that it scores well."
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,94.929,96.49000000000001,"So that was the first
point I wanted to make."
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,96.49,99.508,"The other one is if you
divide things by sex and"
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,99.508,103.571,"your a virgin then there's
numerical instability issues."
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,106.21,108.40899999999999,">> Do you learn about
that on the street?"
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,108.409,110.01100000000001,>> I learned it in a Math book.
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,110.011,114.28099999999999,">> Yes you [NOISE] I'm, I'm going to
move on And so here's the thing."
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,114.281,115.72200000000001,">> All right.
>> Everything just Michael just"
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,115.722,117.8,said except the last part is true.
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,117.8,119.887,"But there's actually a sort of
deeper thing going on here."
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,119.887,123.523,"To me, if you think about the
commonalities of everything we've just"
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,123.523,127.42,"said, it boils down to one thing data,
data, data, data, data, data."
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,127.42,128.461,Data is king in machine learning.
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,128.461,130.60000000000002,"Now Michael would call
himself a computer scientist."
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,130.6,131.429,">> Oh, yeah.
>> And I would call"
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,131.429,133.185,myself a computationalist.
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,133.185,134.258,">> What?
>> What if I'm in a college of"
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,134.258,136.47,"computing at a department
of computer science?"
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,136.47,139.94,"I believe in computing and
computation as being the ultimate thing."
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,139.94,142.073,"So I would call myself
a computationalist, and"
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,142.073,145.98000000000002,"Michael would probably agree with that
just to keep this discussion moving."
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,145.98,146.74699999999999,>> Let's say.
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,146.747,147.65,>> Right.
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,147.65,148.45000000000002,So we're computationalists.
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,148.45,149.88,We believe in computing.
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,149.88,151.18,"That's a good thing.
>> Sure."
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,151.18,153.75900000000001,">> Many of our colleagues who do
computations tend to think in terms of"

by some algorithm?"
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,167.601,168.47,>> Yeah.
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,168.47,170.337,">> And, truthfully,
machine learning is a lot of that."
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,170.337,173.771,"But the difference between the person
who's trying to solve our problem as"
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,173.771,175.569,"an AI person or
as a computing person and"
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,175.569,179.005,"somebody who's trying to solve our

in the section on supervised learning."
V59IUhkRPDY,Comparison of These Parts of ML - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,271.025,273.974,"And then finally, we will spend our
time on reinforcement learning."

i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,11.89,13.88,we're going to talk about are two kinds
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,13.88,16.309,"of supervised learning, and one particular way to"
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,16.309,17.94,"do supervised learning. Okay, so the two"
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,17.94,20.1,types of supervised learning that we typically think
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,20.1,23.830000000000002,about are classification. And regression. And we're going to
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,23.83,25.27,spend most of the time today talking about
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,25.27,27.86,classification and more time next time talking about
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,27.86,30.97,regression. So the difference between classification and regression is
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,30.97,34.06,fairly simple for the purposes of this discussion.
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,34.06,37.75,Classification is simply the process of taking some kind

i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,40.18,42.23,going to define these terms in a couple of minutes.
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,42.23,46.4,"And mapping it to some discrete label. Usually, for"
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,46.4,50.129999999999995,"what we're talking about, something like, true or false."
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,50.13,52.38,"So, what's a good example of that? Imagine"
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,52.38,54.080000000000005,that I have a nice little picture of Michael.
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,54.08,55.5,>> It looks just like me!
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,55.5,58.42,>> It looks exactly like you. So I have a nice little picture here
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,58.42,64.313,and I want to know whether this is a male. Or a female. So
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,64.313,69.56,given an input like this I will map it to male or female. So
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,69.56,71.65,"what do you think, Michael? Do you think this is a male or a female?"
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,71.65,73.2,">> So you're, you're classifying me as male"
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,73.2,75.45,or female based on the picture of me and
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,75.45,79.16,"I would think you know, based on how I look I'm clearly male."
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,79.16,82.64,">> Yes. In fact, manly male. So, this would be"
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,82.64,86.59,a classification from pictures to male. The alternative would be
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,86.59,89.84,"something like a picture to female, and I'm just going to"
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,89.84,96.31,take a completely stereotypical image of either a female or.
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,96.31,99.25,">> I think it's actually, that's actually me when I let my hair go long."
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,99.25,100.55,">> Right, so, so which"
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,100.55,104.1,points out that this can be pretty hard. But this is where we're going to spend
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,104.1,105.6,most of our time talking about it first
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,105.6,107.75,as a classification task. So taking some kind
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,107.75,110.19,"of input, in this case pictures, and mapping"
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,110.19,112.53,"it to some discrete number of labels, true"
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,112.53,117.87,"or false, male or female, car versus cougar,"
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,117.87,119.80000000000001,"anything that, that you might imagine thinking of."
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,119.8,121.81,>> Car versus cougar?
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,121.81,122.25,>> Yes.
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,122.25,125.56,">> That, I guess that's an important thing if you're driving."
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,125.56,128.937,You don't want to run into any cougars or probably other cars either.
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,128.937,130.788,">> Well you know, you're sitting down and you're trying to"
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,130.788,134.33,decide whether you should ride this thing that you see or not.
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,134.33,135.64000000000001,>> And if its a cougar maybe you don't
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,135.64,137.26999999999998,want to and if it's a car maybe you do.
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,137.27,138.98000000000002,>> Excellent. Don't drive a cougar.
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,138.98,141.29,>> Don't drive a cougar. That's the first lesson in machine learning.
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,141.29,141.95,>> Excellent.
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,141.95,146.04999999999998,">> Okay, so that's classification. We'll return to regression in a little"

i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,185.46,187.86,of the difference between classification and regression is
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,187.86,190.62,the difference between mapping from some input
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,190.62,193.21,to some small number of discrete values which
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,193.21,196.906,might represent concepts. And regression is mapping
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,196.906,200.06,from some input space to some real number.
i04Pfrb71vk,Difference between Classification and Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,200.06,201.81,Potentially infinite number of real numbers.

L29Am_JBNm0,Supervised Learning Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,44.55,47.309999999999995,"and you're trying to determine whether given a credit history, I"
L29Am_JBNm0,Supervised Learning Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,47.31,51.2,"should lend this person money, that's question one. Is that classification, or"
L29Am_JBNm0,Supervised Learning Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,51.2,54.39,is that regression? Question two you take as input
L29Am_JBNm0,Supervised Learning Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,54.39,57.11,a picture like the examples that we've given before.
L29Am_JBNm0,Supervised Learning Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,57.11,59.71,And the output of your learning system is going
L29Am_JBNm0,Supervised Learning Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,59.71,63.160000000000004,"to be whether this person is of high school age,"
L29Am_JBNm0,Supervised Learning Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,63.16,68.63,"college age, or grad student age. The third question is very similar."
L29Am_JBNm0,Supervised Learning Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,68.63,73.66,"The input is again a picture. And the output is, I guess, of the actual"
L29Am_JBNm0,Supervised Learning Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,73.66,79.3,"age of the person, 17, 24, 23 and a half, whatever."
L29Am_JBNm0,Supervised Learning Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,79.3,81.24,So take a moment and try to decide
L29Am_JBNm0,Supervised Learning Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,81.24,85.33,whether these are classification tasks or regression tasks.
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.306,2.029,>> And so now let's give the explanation for the quiz.
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,2.029,5.390000000000001,">> Alright, so, let's see what happened here. So,"
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,5.39,7.959999999999999,what you're saying is in some cases the inputs are
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,7.96,11.76,discrete or continuous or complicated. In other cases the outputs
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,11.76,14.29,could be discrete or continuous or complicated. But I think
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,14.29,16.046,"what you were saying is, that what on, on,"
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,16.046,19.099999999999998,what matters to determine if something is classification or regression
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,19.1,22.62,is whether the output is from a discrete small set
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,22.62,25.54,"or, or whether it's some continuous quantity. Is that right?"
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,25.54,27.534,">> Right, that's exactly right. The difference between"
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,27.534,29.82,a classification task or a regression task is
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,29.82,33.08,"not about the input, it's about the output."
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,33.08,36.379999999999995,If the output is continuous then it's regression
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,36.38,39.242000000000004,and if the output is small discrete set
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,39.242,41.989999999999995,"or discrete set, then it is a classification"
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,41.99,46.47,"task. So, with that in mind, what do you think is the answer to the first one?"
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,46.47,48.54,">> So, lend money. If it was something like predicting"
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,48.54,51.129999999999995,"a credit score, that seems like a more continuous quantity."
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,51.13,52.85,"But this is just a yes no, so that's"
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,52.85,55.5,"a discrete class, so I'm going to go with classification."
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,55.5,61.65,">> That is, correct. It is classification and the short answer is, because"
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,61.65,67.06,"it's a binary task. True, false. Yes, no. Lend money or don't lend money."
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,67.06,67.9,>> Got it.
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,67.9,69.98,">> So it's a simple classification test. Okay,"
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,69.98,71.46000000000001,"with that in mind, what about number two?"
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,71.46,73.80999999999999,">> Alright, so number two. It's trying to judge"
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,73.81,76.32000000000001,"something about where they fall on a scale, high school,"
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,76.32,81.11999999999999,"college, or grad student. But all of, the system is being asked to do is put"
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,81.12,83.4,"them into one of those three categories, and"
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,83.4,86.81,"these categories are like classes, so it's classification."
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,86.81,90.29,>> That is also exactly right. Classification. We moved from binary
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,90.29,93.655,"to trinary in this case, but the important thing is that it's"
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,93.655,97.48,"discrete. So it doesn't matter if it's high school, college grad,"
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,97.48,101.366,"professor, elementary school, any number of other ways we might decide where"
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,101.366,104.092,your status of matriculation is is a small discrete
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,104.092,107.30499999999999,"set. So, with that in mind, what about number three?"
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,107.305,110.60000000000001,">> Alright, so the input is the same in this case. And the output is kind of"
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,110.6,113.28,"the same except there's, well there's certainly more"
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,113.28,115.68,categories because there's more possible ages than just those
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,115.68,117.92,three. But when you gave the example you
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,117.92,120.98,"did explicitly say that ages can be fractional like,"
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,120.98,124.13000000000001,"you know, 22.3. So that definitely makes me"
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,124.13,126.53999999999999,"think that it's continuous, so it should be regression."
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,126.54,127.98,">> Right, I think that is exactly the"
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,127.98,129.65,"right thing, you have a continuous output. Now,"
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,129.65,131.20000000000002,I do want to point something out. That
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,131.2,133.26,"while the right answer is regression, a lot of"
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,133.26,135.69,people might have decided that the answer was
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,135.69,139.01,"classification. So, what's an argument? If I told"
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,139.01,140.69,"you in fact the answer was classification, what"
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,140.69,142.0,would be your argument for why that would be?
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,142.0,142.53,">> Well, I guess."
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,142.53,143.1,>> Can you think of one?
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,143.1,144.35,">> Yeah, I guess. I mean, you know,"
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,144.35,146.32,if you think about ages as being discrete. You
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,146.32,151.57,"just say, you know, you can one or two or three or, you know, whatever up to"
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,151.57,154.01,"130, say. But there, but there's just that, that"
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,154.01,156.06,"set. There isn't really, you know, usually we don't talk"
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,156.06,158.655,"about fractional ages. So, so it seems like you could"
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,158.655,160.78,"think of it as, as, as a set of classes."
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,160.78,162.663,">> Right. So let's imagine. So, how"
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,162.663,164.794,old are people? Let's imagine we only cared
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,164.794,168.246,"about years, so you're either one or two or three or four or five. Or maybe"
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,168.246,171.08800000000002,"you can be one and a half, and two and a half, and three and a"
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,171.088,173.59,"half. But, whatever, it's, it's not all possible"
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,173.59,176.75,real number values. And we know that people
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,176.75,183.35,"don't live beyond, say, 250. Well, in that case, you've got a very large"
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,183.35,189.10999999999999,discrete set but it's still discrete. Doesn't matter whether there's two things
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,189.11,195.37,"in your set, three things in your set, or in this case 250 things in"
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,195.37,201.67000000000002,"your set, it's still discrete. So, whether it's regression, or classification,"
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,201.67,204.51999999999998,depends upon exactly how you define your output and these things
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,204.52,208.47,"become important. I'm going to argue that in practice, if you were"
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,208.47,211.17,"going to set up this problem, the easiest way to do it"
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,211.17,213.7,would be to think about it as a real number and
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,213.7,217.89,you would predict something like 23.7. And so it's going to end
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,217.89,220.10999999999999,"up being a regression task and we can might, maybe think"
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,220.11,222.87,about that a little bit more as we move along. So
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,222.87,224.76,either answer would be acceptable depending
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,224.76,226.89999999999998,upon what your explanation of exactly
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,226.9,230.36,what the output was. Was. You buy that?
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,230.36,230.93,>> That makes sense.
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,230.93,234.71800000000002,">> Excellent. Okay. Alright, let's move beyond the"
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,234.718,236.846,quiz and start thinking about exactly what it
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,236.846,239.42000000000002,means to define a classification problem. And then
DZa0puxLd9w,Supervised Learning Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,239.42,241.35999999999999,later what it means to define a regression problem.
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.2,3.6300000000000003,"Okay so, classification learning. Before we get into the details of"
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,3.63,5.62,"that, I want to define a couple of terms. Because we're going to"
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,5.62,7.890000000000001,be throwing these terms out all throughout the lessons. And I
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,7.89,9.709999999999999,want to make certain that we're all on the same page and we
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,9.71,12.06,mean the same thing. But we're returning to this again and
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,12.06,15.18,"again and again. So, the first term I want to introduce is the"
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,15.18,20.13,"notion of instances. So, instances, or another way of thinking about them is"
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,20.13,25.25,"input. Those are vectors of valu, of attributes. That define"
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,25.25,29.22,"whatever your input space is. So they can be pictures,"
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,29.22,32.42,and all the pixels that make up pictures like we've been
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,32.42,38.35,doing so far before. They can be credit score examples like
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,38.35,41.265,"how much money I make, or how much money Michael makes."
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,41.265,43.93,>> [LAUGH]
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,43.93,46.76,"How much money I wish I made, so on and so fourth. So"
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,46.76,50.379999999999995,"whatever your input value is, whatever it is you're using to describe the input,"
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,50.38,53.07,"whether it's pixels or its discrete values, those are"
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,53.07,55.57,"your instances, the set of things that you're looking"
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,55.57,58.17,"at. So you have instances, that's the set of"
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,58.17,61.15,inputs that you have. And then what we're trying
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,61.15,63.53,to find is some kind of function And that
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,63.53,65.78,is the concept that we care about. And this
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,65.78,70.72,"function actually maps inputs to outputs, so it takes"
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,70.72,75.61,"the instances, it maps them in this case to some"
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,75.61,78.65,"kind of output such as true or false. This is the,"
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,78.65,81.52000000000001,the categories of things that we're worried about. And for most of
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,81.52,84.14999999999999,"the conversation that we're going to be having, we're going to be thinking"
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,84.15,88.14,"about binary classification, just true and false. But the truth is, this"
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,88.14,91.02,"would work whether there were three outputs, as we did with"
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,91.02,94.33999999999999,"high school, college, or grad school, or whether there were 250 as"
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,94.34,97.45,we were contemplating for ages. But the main thing here is the
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,97.45,102.64,"concept, is the function that we care about that's going to map pictures,"
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,102.64,104.3,"for example, to true or false."
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,104.3,107.19,">> So okay, I get, I get the use of the word,"" instance"", right?"" Instance"""
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,107.19,112.13,"is just, like, a single thing that's out there. But I have an intuitive notion"
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,112.13,116.6,"of what a concept is. How does that relate to this more formal notion? Like,"
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,116.6,120.13,"can we connect this to, kind of, the intuitive notion of what a concept is?"
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,120.13,124.19999999999999,">> I guess so. So a concept, I don't know. How"
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,124.2,127.62,"would you want to put that? So a concept is something That,"
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,127.62,129.07,I mean were talking about is a notion of a
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,129.07,131.42,"function, so what it means formally is that you have"
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,131.42,134.95,"some input, like a picture, and it immediately inputs maps"
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,134.95,137.98,anything in that input space to some particular defined output
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,137.98,140.10999999999999,"space, like true or false, or male or female, or"
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,140.11,144.64000000000001,"credit, credit worthy or not. Intuitively a concept is an"
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,144.64,148.98,"idea describes a set of things. OK, so we can"
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,148.98,152.725,talk about maleness or femaleness. We can talk about short and
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,152.725,154.95,tall; we can talk about college students
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,154.95,157.39,and grad students. And so the concept is
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,157.39,160.26,"the notion of what creditworthiness is, what"
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,160.26,162.39999999999998,"a male is, what a college student is."
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,162.4,164.99,">> Okay, I think I see that. So, so essentially if you want to think"
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,164.99,169.39000000000001,"of tallness, the concept of tallness, one way to define it is to say, Well in"
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,169.39,172.48,general if you give me something I can tell you rather or not its [UNKNOWN]
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,172.48,176.51999999999998,so it's going to map those somethings to am I tall or not. True or false.
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,176.52,178.58,>> Right. Exactly and so
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,178.58,181.09,really when you think about any concept and we talk about
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,181.09,184.70000000000002,this in generally [UNKNOWN] is effectively a way of saying is
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,184.7,188.69,effectively a set of things. That are apart of that concept.
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,188.69,191.17,"So, you can have a concept of a car and if I"
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,191.17,193.82,"gave you ""cars"" you would say these things are in it"
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,193.82,196.4,"and if I gave you ""non-cars"" you would say they are not."
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,196.4,200.20000000000002,"And so a concept is, therefore by definition, a mapping between"
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,200.2,203.57999999999998,"objects in a world and membership in a set, which makes it"
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,203.58,203.92000000000002,a function.
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,203.92,205.13,">> Okay, that makes sense."
IrM0MNi_Kxk,Classification Learning One - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,205.13,205.72,>> Okay.
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.28,4.63,"So with that, with that notion of a concept as functions or as mappings from"
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,4.63,12.02,objects to membership in a set we have a particular target concept. And the
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,12.02,14.18,only difference between a target concept and
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,14.18,16.53,the general notion of concept is that
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,16.53,18.39,the target concept is the thing we're
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,18.39,20.54,trying to find. It's the actual answer. All
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,24.29,28.669999999999998,"right? So, a function that determines whether something is a car"
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,28.67,32.13,"or not, or male or not, is the target concept. Now"
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,32.13,34.86,"this is actually important, right, because we could say that. We"
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,34.86,37.44,have this notion in our head of things that are cars
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,37.44,40.519999999999996,"or things that are males, or thing, or people who are"
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,40.52,44.18000000000001,credit worthy but unless we actually have it written down somewhere
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,44.18,46.61,we don't know whether it's right or wrong. So there is
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,46.61,49.61,some target concept we're trying to get of all the concepts
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,49.61,52.87,that might map pictures or people to true and false.
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,52.87,55.65,">> Okay, so if you trying to teach me what tallness is so"
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,55.65,58.48,"you have this kind of concept in mind of these, these things are"
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,58.48,60.66,tall and these things are not tall. So you're going to have to
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,60.66,64.47999999999999,somehow convey that to me. So how are you going to teach me?
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,64.48,67.17,">> So that's exactly the, well that's what comes up"
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,67.17,68.77,with the rest of these things that we're defining here.
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,68.77,68.8,>> Okay.
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,68.8,71.32,>> So let me tell you what the next four things
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,71.32,74.14999999999999,are then you can tell me whether that answers your question.
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,74.15,74.61,>> Got it.
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,74.61,76.76,">> How about that? OK, so we've got a notion"
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,76.76,79.84,"of instances, input, we've got a notion of concepts. Which"
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,79.84,82.3,take input and maps into some kind of output. And
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,82.3,85.86999999999999,"we've got some target concepts, some specific function from"
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,85.87,88.01,"particular idea that we're trying to find, we're trying to"
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,88.01,91.63000000000001,represent. But out of what? So that's where the hypothesis
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,91.63,94.11999999999999,comes in. And in fact I think it's better to
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,94.12,100.32000000000001,say hypothesis class. So that's the set of all concepts
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,100.32,103.30999999999999,that you're willing to entertain. So it's
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,103.31,105.44,all the functions I'm willing to think about.
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,105.44,108.02,>> So why wouldn't it just be all possible functions?
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,108.02,109.94,>> It could be all possible functions
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,109.94,112.25,and that's a perfectly reasonable hypothesis class. The
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,112.25,115.48,"problem with that is that if it is all possible functions it may be very, very"
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,115.48,118.96000000000001,hard for you to figure out which function is
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,118.96,121.3,the right one given finite data. So when
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,121.3,125.55,we actually go over decision trees next I think it will be kind of clear why
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,125.55,128.169,you need to pick a specific hypothesis class.
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,128.169,128.97,>> Okay.
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,128.97,131.27,>> So let's return to that in a little
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,131.27,133.9,"bit but it's an excellent question. So, conceptually in the"
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,133.9,136.4,"back of your head until we, we come to"
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,136.4,139.39000000000001,"specific examples, you can think of hypothesis class as simply"
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,139.39,141.54999999999998,being all possible functions in the world. On the
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,141.55,145.13000000000002,"other hand, even so far just the classification learning, we"
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,145.13,147.76999999999998,already know that we're restricting ourselves to a subset of
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,147.77,150.62,"all possible functions in the world, because all possible functions"
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,150.62,153.57,"in the world includes things like x squared, and that's regeression."
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,153.57,156.97,"And we've already said, we're not doing regression. We're doing classification."
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,156.97,160.89,So already hypothesis classes all functions we care about and maybe
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,160.89,165.42999999999998,it's all classification functions. So we've already picked a subset. So we
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,165.43,167.94,"got all these incidences, got all these concepts, we want to"
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,167.94,170.87,"find a, a particular concept and we've got this set of"
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,170.87,173.22,functions we're willing to look at. So how are we going
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,173.22,175.63,to determine what the right answer is. So if you try to
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,175.63,179.91,answer Micheal's question that we do that in machine learning is with
idSVqYRwCDA,Classification Learning Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,179.91,184.54999999999998,a sample or another name for which I prefer is a training set.
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.45,2.7600000000000002,So what's a training set? Well a training set is
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,2.76,4.91,"a set of all of our inputs, like pictures of"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,4.91,10.219999999999999,"people, paired with a label, which is the correct output."
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,10.22,13.46,"So in this case, yes, this person is credit worthy."
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,13.46,15.393,>> [LAUGH]
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,15.393,17.2,>> Versus another example.
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,17.2,19.419999999999998,>> You can tell I'm credit worthy based on my curly hair.
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,19.42,21.400000000000002,>> Purely on the hair.
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,21.4,25.49,>> Versus someone who has no curly hair and therefore
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,25.49,28.409999999999997,is obviously not credit worthy. And if you get bunches
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,28.41,32.46,"and bunches of examples of input and output pairs, that's a"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,32.46,35.1,training set. And that's what's going to be the basis
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,35.1,38.15,for you figuring out what is the correct concept or function.
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,38.15,41.032,">> I see. So instead of just telling me what tall means, you're"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,41.032,43.88999999999999,"going to give me lots of examples of, this is tall, this is"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,43.89,46.27,"not tall, this is tall, this is tall, this is tall, this is"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,46.27,51.24,not tall. And that's the way that you're explaining what the target concept is.
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,51.24,53.14,>> Right. So if you want to think about this in
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,53.14,55.57,"the real world, it's as if we're walking down the street"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,55.57,58.404,"and I'm pointing out cars to you, and non-cars to you,"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,58.404,61.46,rather than trying to give you a dictionary that defines exactly
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,61.46,65.019,what a car is. And that is fundamentally inductive learning as
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,65.019,68.31,"we talked about before. Lots and lots of examples, lots of"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,68.31,73.19,"labels. Now I have to generalize beyond that. So, last few"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,73.19,76.3,"things that we we talk about, last two terms I want"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,76.3,79.63,"to introduce are candidate, and testing set. So what's"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,79.63,82.78,"a candidate? Well a candidate is just simply the, a"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,82.78,87.36,"concept that you think might be the target concept. So,"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,87.36,89.75,"for example, I might have, right now, you already did"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,89.75,91.822,"this where you said, oh, okay I see, clearly I'm"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,91.822,95.14,"credit worthy because I have curly hair. So, you've effectively"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,95.14,98.32000000000001,"asserted a particular function that looks at, looks for curly"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,98.32,102.006,"hair, and says, if there's curly hair there, the person's"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,102.006,105.32,credit worthy. Which is certainly how I think about it. And
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,105.32,107.83999999999999,"people who are not curly hair, or do not have curly hair"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,107.84,111.16,"are, in fact, not credit worthy. So, that's your target concept."
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,111.16,113.0,"And so, then, the question is, given that you have a bunch"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,113.0,117.49,"of examples, and you have a particular candidate or a candidate"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,117.49,120.08999999999999,"concept, how do you know whether you are right or wrong? How"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,120.09,122.9,do you know whether it's a good candidate or not? And that's
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,122.9,127.12,where the testing set comes in. So a testing set looks just
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,127.12,130.81,"like a training set. So here our training set, we'll"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,130.81,133.17000000000002,have pictures and whether someone turns out to be credit worthy
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,133.17,136.58999999999997,or not. And I will take your candidate concept and
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,136.59,139.66,"I'll determine whether it does a good job or not, by"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,139.66,142.52,"looking at the testing set. So in this case, because"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,142.52,145.94,"you decided curly hair matters, I have drawn, I have given"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,145.94,148.41,"you two examples from a training set, both of which have"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,148.41,152.96,"curly hair, but only one of which is deemed credit worthy."
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,152.96,155.6,Which means your target concept is probably not right.
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,155.6,157.4,">> So to do that test I, guess you can go"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,157.4,160.53,"through all the pictures in the testing set, apply the candidate"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,160.53,163.64000000000001,"concept to see whether it says true or false, and then"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,163.64,166.41,compare that to what the testing set actually says that answer is.
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,166.41,168.54,">> Right, and that'll give you an error. So, by the way,"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,168.54,172.67,"the true target, the true target concept is whether you smile or not."
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,172.67,177.23999999999998,>> Oh. That does make somebody credit worthy.
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,177.24,178.36,>> It does
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,178.36,181.12,"in my world. Or at least I, wish it did"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,181.12,184.96,"in my world. Okay. So, by the way an important point"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,184.96,188.69,is that the training set and the testing set should
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,188.69,191.74,"not be the same. If you learn from your training set,"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,191.74,193.97,"and I test you only on your training set, then"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,193.97,197.05,that's considered cheating in the machine learning world. Because then you
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,197.05,200.126,haven't really shown the ability to generalize. So typically we want
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,200.126,203.62,"the training set to include lots of examples that you don't,"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,203.62,207.01,"the testing set, I'm sorry, to include lots of examples that you don't"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,207.01,209.82999999999998,see in your training set. And that is proof that you're able to generalize.
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,209.83,211.91000000000003,">> I see. So that, and that makes intuitive sense,"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,211.91,213.76,"right? So, like, if, if you're a teacher and you're"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,213.76,216.53,"telling me, you give me a bunch of fact and"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,216.53,218.59,"then you test me exactly that bunch of facts, it"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,218.59,220.888,"doesn't, I don't have to have understood them. I just"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,220.888,223.17000000000002,can regurgitate them back. If you really want to see
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,223.17,225.07,"if I got the right concept, you have to see"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,225.07,228.19,whether or not I can apply that concept in new examples.
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,228.19,228.76,">> Yes,"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,228.76,231.76,which is exactly why our final exams are written the way that they are
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,231.76,234.60999999999999,written. Because you can argue that I've
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,234.61,236.49,"learned something by doing memorization, but the"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,236.49,238.45000000000002,truth is you haven't. You've just memorized.
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,238.45,240.04999999999998,Here you have to do generalization. As
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,240.05,242.08,"you remember from our last discussion, generalization"
nF3r05N3Edc,Classification Learning Three - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,242.08,244.08,is the whole point of machine learning.
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.32,1.9000000000000001,">> All right, so we've defined our terms, we,"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,1.9,5.1,"we know, what it takes to do, at least"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,5.1,7.359999999999999,supervised learning. So now I want to do a specific
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,7.36,11.14,"algorithm and a specific representation, that allows us to solve"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,11.14,16.740000000000002,"the problem of going from instances to, actual concepts."
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,16.74,20.139999999999997,So what we're going to talk about next are decision trees.
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,20.14,22.23,And I think the best way to introduce decision
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,22.23,25.5,"trees is through an example. So, here's the very simple"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,25.5,26.9,example I want you to think about for a
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,26.9,30.5,while. You're on a date with someone. And you come
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,30.5,32.84,to a restaurant. And you're going to try to decide
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,32.84,37.63,"whether to enter the restaurant or not. So, your, input,"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,37.63,40.45,your instances are going to be features about the
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,40.45,43.74,restaurant. And we'll talk a little bit about what those
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,43.74,46.910000000000004,features might be. And the output is whether you
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,46.91,50.184,"should enter or not. Okay, so it's a very simple,"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,50.184,52.485,straightforward problem but there are a lot of
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,52.485,54.57,details here that we have to figure out.
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,54.57,55.71,>> It's a classification problem.
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,55.71,57.8,>> It's clearly a classification problem because
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,57.8,60.15,"the output is yes, we should enter or"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,60.15,62.86,"no, we should move on to the next restaurant. So in fact, it's not just"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,62.86,65.519,"a classification problem, it's those binary classification"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,65.519,67.58000000000001,problems that I said that we'd almost exclusively
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,67.58,70.11,be thinking about for the next few minutes.
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,70.11,71.588,"Okay. So, you understand the problem set up?"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,71.588,75.27,">> Yes, though I'm not sure exactly what the pieces of the input are."
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,75.27,78.57,">> Right, so thats actually the right next question to ask. We"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,78.57,82.25,have to actually be specific now about a representation. Before I was drawing
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,82.25,85.94,"squiggly little lines and you could imagine what they were, but now since"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,85.94,88.7,"we're really going to go through an example, we need to be clear about"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,88.7,90.88000000000001,what is it mean to be standing in front of the restaurant.
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,90.88,93.64999999999999,"So, let's try to figure out how we would represent that, how we"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,93.65,96.82000000000001,"would define that. We're talking about, you're standing in front of a restaurant"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,96.82,100.28999999999999,or eatery because I can't see the reliably small restaurant. And we're going to
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,100.29,102.76,try to figure out whether we're going to go in
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,102.76,107.5,"or not. But, what do we have to describe our"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,107.5,110.19,eatery? What do we have? What are our attributes? What
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,110.19,114.8,"are the instances actually made of? So, what in, or"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,114.8,117.50999999999999,"another way of putting it is, what are the features"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,117.51,119.27000000000001,that we need to pay attention to that are going to
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,119.27,122.32,"help us to determine whether we should yes, enter into"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,122.32,125.44999999999999,"the restaurant. Or no, move on to the next restaurant."
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,125.45,126.35000000000001,"So, any ideas Michael?"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,126.35,130.85,>> Sure. I guess there's like the type of restaurant.
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,130.85,132.91,">> Okay,"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,132.91,135.504,">> Oh, is it tall or short, and is it a good credit risk?"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,135.504,136.26299999999998,>> [LAUGH]
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,136.263,137.71,">> Oh wait, no, no, no wait, I know."
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,137.71,141.91,"Like the Italian versus French, versus, you know, Vietnamese."
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,141.91,143.07999999999998,>> So let's call that the type.
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,145.26,147.108,"So it could be Italian, it could be French, it could"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,147.108,149.94,"be Thai, it could be American, there are American restaurants, right?"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,149.94,150.3,>> Sure.
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,150.3,155.06,">> Greek, it can be, Armenian. It can any kind of"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,155.06,158.39000000000001,"restaurant you want to. Okay, good. So that's something that probably"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,158.39,160.94,matters because maybe you don't like Italian food or maybe you're
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,160.94,163.94,really in the mood for Thai. Sounds perfect. Okay anything else?
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,163.94,167.85999999999999,>> Sure. How about whether it smells good?
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,167.86,171.18,">> You know, I like cleanliness. Let's let's, or"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,171.18,174.15,"you know what, let's, let's be nice to our eateries and let's say atmosphere."
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,174.15,177.383,">> Mm. Right because if there's, you know, no atmosphere,"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,177.383,178.87,then it is going to be really hard to breathe.
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,178.87,181.66,>> That's exactly right. So is it
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,181.66,187.52,"fancy? Is it a hole-in-the-wall, which I'm going"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,187.52,191.32000000000002,"to spell HIW. Is it a hole-in-the-wall,"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,191.32,193.75,"umm, those sorts of things. The, you know?"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,193.75,195.73,">> Casual, I guess, is another category."
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,195.73,196.79,>> Casual.
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,198.94,200.06,"And so on, and so forth. You could imagine"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,200.06,202.12,"lots of things like that, but these things might matter"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,202.12,204.74,"to you and your date. Okay, so, we know the"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,204.74,207.51000000000002,"type of the restaurant that we have, we know whether"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,207.51,210.35999999999999,"it's fancy, whether it's casual, whether it's a hole"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,210.36,212.37,in the wall. Some of the best food I've ever
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,212.37,215.05,"had are in you know, well-known hole in the walls."
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,215.05,216.35000000000002,Those sorts of things. Anything else you can think of?
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,216.35,219.71,">> Sure, Sometimes, I might use"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,219.71,221.55,something like looking inside and seeing whether
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,221.55,223.96,there's people in there and whether they look they're having a good time.
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,223.96,228.67000000000002,>> Right. So that's an important thing. So let's just say
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,230.73,234.94,If it's occupied. Now why might that matter in reality? Well
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,234.94,238.53,it matters because if it's completely full and you may have to
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,238.53,240.21,"wait for a very long time, you might not want to"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,240.21,242.88,go in. On the other hand. If you're looking at a restaurant
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,242.88,245.51,"you've never heard of, and there's only two people in it,"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,245.51,250.03,and it's Friday at 7 p.m. Maybe that says something about something.
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,250.03,252.11,"Maybe you want it to be quiet. You know, those sorts"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,252.11,255.98000000000002,"of things might matter. Okay, so, we've got type, we've got atmosphere,"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,255.98,257.519,we've got occupied. Anything else you can think of?
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,258.93,261.81,">> And I have been out of the dating market for a while, but I guess"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,261.81,264.61,"it could imagine, I could imagine how hard"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,264.61,267.26,I am trying to work to impress my date.
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,267.26,269.98,">> perfect. So do you have a hot date or not? Or, this is"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,269.98,273.68,"someone who you really, really, really want to impress and so, maybe it matters"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,273.68,276.31,"then, it's even more important whether it's a fancy restaurant or a hole in"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,276.31,278.15,"the wall, or whether it's French or"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,278.15,281.28999999999996,whether it's an American restaurant. That make sense?
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,281.29,283.22,"I think that makes sense. Notice, by the way, that the"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,283.22,287.54,first two sets that we have have multiple possible categories here.
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,287.54,289.886,"So it could be Italian, French, Thai, American, so on and"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,289.886,293.99,"so forth. Atmosphere is something that can have many, many possible"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,293.99,296.49,"values, but the last two things that we talked about were"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,296.49,301.02,all binary. Either it's occupied or it's not. Yes or no
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,301.02,303.54999999999995,"or, you have a hot date or you don't. And I"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,303.55,306.52000000000004,"think we could go on like this for a long time but,"
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,306.52,309.09999999999997,let's try to move on to maybe a couple of other features
sjnV76u_Nvs,Example 1: Dating - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,309.1,311.46000000000004,and then try to actually figure out how we may actually solve this.
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.33,3.444,">> Alright, so Michael. Last set of features that that's come up"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,3.444,6.22,"with three or four, three or four more features and then move on."
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,6.22,6.49,>> Sure.
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,6.49,7.11,>> So come up with a couple.
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,7.11,11.46,">> Alright, so I could, sometimes I'll look at the menu that's"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,11.46,14.8,"posted outside, and I'll see if the, you know? How pricey it is."
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,14.8,19.11,">> Okay, so cost. Right, so cost can be represented as discrete"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,19.11,22.358999999999998,"input. By the way, it could also be represented as an actual number."
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,25.28,28.580000000000002,"Right? We could say, look it's cheap, it's moderately"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,28.58,31.97,"expensive, it's really expensive or you could have a number"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,31.97,34.65,which is the average cost of an entry. And it
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,34.65,36.85,"doesn't really matter for, for what we're talking about now"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,36.85,40.27,but just some way of representing cost. Okay. Just
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,40.27,41.75,give me one or two more features but I want
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,41.75,43.97,to give me some features that don't have anything to
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,43.97,47.22,do with the restraunt itself but might still be important.
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,47.22,47.81,>> Hmm.
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,47.81,50.32,">> because, by the way, hot date probably doesn't have anything to"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,50.32,52.13,"do with the restaurant itself. So, even though we've"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,52.13,54.24,been talking the features of the restaurant. We've actually
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,54.24,56.67,"been picking up, at least, one feature that doesn't"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,56.67,58.82,have anything to do directly with the restaurant itself.
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,58.82,61.53,">> Not to. So, whether I'm hungry?"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,61.53,64.459,>> I like that. Here's another one.
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,64.459,66.63000000000001,What's the weather like. Is it raining outside?
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,66.63,69.17999999999999,>> Which is a different sense of atmosphere.
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,70.33,72.992,">> Right. because if it's raining outside, maybe it's not"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,72.992,75.36,"your, your favorite choice but you don't want to walk anymore."
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,75.36,77.75,"Okay, so we have a ton of features here. We've gone"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,77.75,79.87,through a few of them. Notice that some of the specifically have
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,79.87,82.39,to do with the restaurant and some of them have to do
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,82.39,85.71,with things that are external to the restaurant itself but you can
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,85.71,90.78999999999999,imagine that they're all important. Or possibly important to whether you
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,90.79,94.47000000000001,should enter into the restaurant or not. Agreed? And there's a bunch
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,94.47,97.65,of features you could imagine coming up with that probably have nothing
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,97.65,100.80000000000001,to do with whether you should enter into the restaurant or not.
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,100.8,106.7,"Like, how many cars are currently parked across the country."
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,106.7,109.02,Probably doesn't have an impact on whether you're going to
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,109.02,111.67,"enter into a specific restaurant or not. Okay. So, we"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,111.67,113.85000000000001,have a whole bunch of features and right now we're sticking
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,113.85,116.69999999999999,with features we think that might be relevant. And we're
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,116.7,120.42,"going to use those to make some kind of decision. So,"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,120.42,123.91,"that gets us to decision trees. So, the first thing,"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,123.91,125.89999999999999,"that, that we want to do is, we want to separate"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,125.9,128.669,out what a decision tree is from the
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,128.669,130.84,algorithm that you might use to build the decision
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,130.84,134.805,tree. So the first thing we want to think about is the fact that a decision tree
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,134.805,137.78,has a specific representation. Then only after we
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,137.78,140.86,"understand that representation and go through an example, we'll"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,140.86,143.60000000000002,start thinking about an algorithm for finding or
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,143.6,145.98,"building a decision tree. Okay, are you with me?"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,145.98,147.13,>> Yeah.
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,147.13,150.73,">> Excellent. Okay, so a decision tree is a very simple thing."
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,150.73,155.75,"Well, you might be, might be surprised to know it's a tree, the first part of"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,155.75,163.87,"it. And it looks kind of like this. So, what I've drawn for you is example."
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,163.87,167.08,"Sample generic, decision tree. And what you'll see"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,167.08,168.97,is three parts to it. The first thing
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,168.97,170.93,you'll see is a circle. These are called
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,170.93,175.63,"nodes, and these are in fact, decision nodes. So,"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,175.63,182.04,"what you do here, is you pick a particular attribute. [NOISE]"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,182.04,186.45,"And you ask a question about it. The answer to that question, which is its"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,186.45,192.25,value for what the edges represent in your tree. Okay. So we have these nodes
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,192.25,194.48,"which represent attributes, and we have edges"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,194.48,196.57,which represent value. So let's be specific about
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,196.57,198.53,what that means. So here's a particular attribute
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,198.53,200.53,we might pick for the top node here.
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,200.53,204.07,Let's call it hungry. That's one of the features
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,204.07,205.72,that Michael came up with. Am I hungry or
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,205.72,209.22,not? And there's only two possible answers for that.
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,209.22,212.46,"yes, I'm hungry, true, or false, I am not hungry."
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,214.54,216.23999999999998,And each of these nodes represent some
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,216.24,220.63,attribute. And the edges represent the answers
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,220.63,224.04,for specific values. So it's as if I'm making a bunch of decisions by asking
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,224.04,228.65,"a series of questions. Am I hungry? And if the answer is yes, I am"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,228.65,233.87,"hungry, then I go and I ask a different question. Like is it rainy outside?"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,238.01,243.03,"And maybe it is rainy and maybe it's not rainy, and let's say if it isn't rainy"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,243.03,247.75,"then I want to make a decision, and so these square boxes here are the"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,247.75,252.79,"actual output. Okay so it's hungry, so you're hungry, yes, and it's not"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,252.79,258.40999999999997,"raining, so what do you do? So, let's just say you go in."
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,260.73,265.08000000000004,"True, I go in so, when it's, I'm hungry and it's not raining, I go in."
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,265.08,267.87,">> And that, that true is answering a different question. It's not in the"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,267.87,271.99,"nodes I guess. So, in the leaves, the t and f means something different."
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,271.99,273.91,">> That's right. It's the out, that's exactly right. The,"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,273.91,276.3,"the leaves, the little boxes, the leaves of your decision"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,276.3,282.02000000000004,tree is your answer. What's on the on the edges
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,282.02,285.83,are the possible values that your attribute can take on.
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,285.83,289.03,"So, in fact, let's try to, let's make that clear by picking a different"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,289.03,291.25,by picking another possible attribute. You could
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,291.25,295.49,"imagine that if I am not hungry, what's"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,295.49,300.51,"going to matter a lot now is say, the type of restaurant, right. Which we"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,300.51,301.83,"said there were many, many types of"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,301.83,308.412,"restaurants. So, you know thai, I forget [CROSSTALK]"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,308.412,309.662,>> Italian.
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,309.662,311.45,">> Italian, and"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,311.45,311.93,"you know, something."
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,311.93,312.43,>> French fries.
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,313.53,316.45,">> And French Fries. So if I'm not hungry, then"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,316.45,318.53999999999996,"what matters a lot more is the type of restaurant,"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,318.54,321.06,and so I'll move down this path instead and start
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,321.06,324.93,"asking other questions. But ultimately, no matter how I, what"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,324.93,326.86,this decision tree allows me to do is to ask
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,326.86,330.33000000000004,"a series of questions and depending upon those answers, move"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,330.33,334.66999999999996,"down the tree, until eventually I have some particular ouput"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,334.67,336.49,"answer, yes I go in the resteraunt, or no I do"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,336.49,336.6,not
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,336.6,338.64000000000004,">> Ok this is still seeming a little abstract to me,"
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,338.64,342.81,"can we, can we maybe work through a very concrete example."
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,342.81,344.03000000000003,">> Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense."
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,344.03,344.63,>> Let's do a quiz.
F8oLgbLh_xo,Representation - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,344.63,347.69,">> Ha, okay, let's do a quiz."
wk1mWB1fdqY,Representation Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.2,3.1100000000000003,"Okay, so we've now seen an abstract example of"
wk1mWB1fdqY,Representation Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,3.11,5.42,decision trees. So let's make certain that we understand
wk1mWB1fdqY,Representation Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,5.42,8.27,"it with a concrete example. So, to your right"
wk1mWB1fdqY,Representation Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,8.27,12.78,is a specific decision tree that looks at some of
wk1mWB1fdqY,Representation Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,12.78,15.01,the features that we talked about. Whether you are
wk1mWB1fdqY,Representation Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,15.01,18.28,"occupied or not, whether the restaurant is occupied or not"
wk1mWB1fdqY,Representation Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,18.28,21.364,what type of restaurant it is. Your choices are
wk1mWB1fdqY,Representation Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,21.364,25.25,"pizza, Thai, or other. And whether the people inside look"
wk1mWB1fdqY,Representation Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,25.25,29.3,happy or not. The possible outputs are again binary
wk1mWB1fdqY,Representation Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,29.3,33.18,"either you don't go or you do go, into"
wk1mWB1fdqY,Representation Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,33.18,36.61,the restaurant. On your left is a table which
wk1mWB1fdqY,Representation Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,36.61,40.21,has six of the features that we've talked about. Whether
wk1mWB1fdqY,Representation Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,40.21,42.06,"the restaurant is occupied or not, the type of"
wk1mWB1fdqY,Representation Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,42.06,44.99,"restaurant, whether it's raining outside or not, whether your hungry"
wk1mWB1fdqY,Representation Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,44.99,46.97,or not. Whether you're on a hot and whether
wk1mWB1fdqY,Representation Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,46.97,50.31,"the people inside look happy, and some values for each"
wk1mWB1fdqY,Representation Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,50.31,53.300000000000004,of those. And what we would like for you to do is to
wk1mWB1fdqY,Representation Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,53.3,56.32,tell us what the output of this decision tree would be in each case.
wk1mWB1fdqY,Representation Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,56.32,58.97,">> Alright, so the decision tree here is a, it's"
wk1mWB1fdqY,Representation Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,58.97,61.25,"a classifier, but we had another name. Oh, it's a concept."
wk1mWB1fdqY,Representation Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,61.25,61.61,>> Yes.
wk1mWB1fdqY,Representation Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,61.61,64.81,">> Alright, and each row of this is a different time that"
wk1mWB1fdqY,Representation Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,64.81,68.97,"we're stopping at a restaurant, and the, the little values there summarize what"
wk1mWB1fdqY,Representation Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,68.97,72.74,"is true about this particular situation. And, and you're saying we need"
wk1mWB1fdqY,Representation Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,72.74,75.74,"to then trace through this decision tree and figure out what class is,"
wk1mWB1fdqY,Representation Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,75.74,77.19999999999999,"okay yeah, that's what you said. Okay, I'm"
wk1mWB1fdqY,Representation Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,77.2,80.67,"ready. Alright, perfect. Okay, that's the quiz, go."
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.12,1.569,You've got your answers. Let me tell you what
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,1.569,4.019,we think the answers are. Now the nice thing
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,4.019,8.32,"about a decision tree sort of conceptually and intuitively,"
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,8.32,10.67,is that it really is asking a series of
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,10.67,14.1,"questions. So, we can simply look at these rows"
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,14.1,17.2,over here and the values that our features have
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,17.2,19.5,and we can just follow down the path of
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,19.5,24.84,"the tree. So, in the first case. We have true."
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,24.84,29.97,"We have true for occupied, which means we want to go"
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,29.97,34.47,down the right side of the tree. And check on the
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,34.47,37.6,"type. So in the first case, the type is pizza."
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,39.2,42.329,And so we go down the first branch and that means.
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,44.61,49.28,"We do not go down the tree. So, the output is no go."
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,49.28,52.61,">> So, okay, so now, I got a different answer. So, I looked at this"
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,52.61,58.019999999999996,"and I said happiness is true. And, the bottom box says happiness true, you go."
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,58.02,60.482000000000006,">> Right. So, you got the wrong, you got what I'm"
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,60.482,63.15,going to tell you is the wrong answer by going from the
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,63.15,65.97,bottom of the tree up. The way decision trees work is
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,65.97,70.17,you always start at the root of the tree. That is
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,70.17,74.25,"the very top of the tree. And you ask the questions in tho, in that order."
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,74.25,76.6,>> It just seems like it would be faster to start at the bottom.
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,76.6,80.19999999999999,>> Yeah but then you would never look at anything else in the tree.
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,80.2,81.89,>> Good point. All right so.
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,81.89,85.09,">> If you start at the bottom, you can't go up. Alright. So, okay, so let"
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,85.09,88.10000000000001,"me see if I get this straight. So I'll, I'll do the, the second instance. The"
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,88.1,91.17999999999999,"second instance, you say that we need to start at the top of the tree where"
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,91.18,93.22000000000001,it says occupied. And so now I look
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,93.22,95.6,at the instance and the instance says that it's
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,95.6,99.16999999999999,"false for occupied, so we go down that left branch and we hit no"
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,99.17,104.14,go. Oh wait but now I haven't look at any of the other nodes.
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,104.14,105.35,>> You don't have to look at any of the other
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,105.35,108.91999999999999,nodes because it turns out that if it's not occupied you
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,108.92,110.71000000000001,just don't go into a restaurant. So you're the type of
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,110.71,113.86999999999999,person who doesn't like to be the only person in a restaurant.
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,113.87,118.0,">> Got it, all right, so that's a no go. So"
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,118.0,120.76,"that's a no-go. That's an important point, Michael. Actually, you might also"
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,120.76,124.69000000000001,"notice that this whole tree, even if you look at every single feature in the"
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,124.69,130.518,"tree, only has three of the attributes. It only"
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,130.518,135.86,looks at occupied. Type. And happiness.
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,135.86,138.93,">> I see. So hot date is sort of irrelevant which is good,"
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,138.93,142.46,because in this case it's not really changing from instance to instance anyway.
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,142.46,144.93,>> True. And neither is hungry you might notice.
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,144.93,147.6,">> Oh, I am kind of hungry."
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,147.6,151.26999999999998,">> Although, I'm always hungry. Although raining does in fact change"
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,151.27,153.55,a little bit here and there. But it apparently it doesn't matter.
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,153.55,154.32000000000002,>> I see.
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,154.32,155.89,>> Because you always take an umbrella.
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,155.89,156.82,>> Got it.
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,156.82,158.06,">> Okay, so let's quickly do the other three"
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,158.06,160.09,and see if we we come to the same conclusion.
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,160.09,162.12,>> Alright. Well all the instances that have occupied
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,162.12,164.41,"false we know those are no go, right away."
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,164.41,165.13,">> Oh, good point."
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,165.13,168.01,>> So we can do it kind of out of order. And
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,168.01,172.45,the other ones are both occupied. One is tie and one is other.
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,172.45,174.31,For the tie one we go.
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,176.65,178.87,"The other one, oh I see, for the other"
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,178.87,180.83,one we have to look at whether there's happiness
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,180.83,183.86,"or not, and in this instance happiness is true."
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,183.86,185.22000000000003,So we get on the right branch and we go.
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,185.22,190.6,">> And we go. Exactly it. So we notice hot date doesn't matter,"
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,190.6,194.64,hungry doesn't matter and rainy doesn't matter. And the only thing that matters
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,194.64,196.79,"are whether you're occupied, what type"
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,196.79,197.84,of restaurant you're at and whether you're
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,197.84,202.02,"happy or not. Or whether the, the patrons in the restaurants are restaurant is,"
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,202.02,204.34,"are happy or not. But, here's the other thing"
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,204.34,206.29,about this. It's not just about the features. Let's tie
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,206.29,208.16,"it back in to the other things, that we"
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,208.16,213.98,"mentioned in the beginning. This, in our case, this table"
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,213.98,217.73,actually represents our testing set. It's the thing that
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,217.73,220.42,we're going to look at to determine whether we were
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,220.42,222.36999999999998,right or wrong. These are the examples that we're going to
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,222.37,227.21,do to see whether we generalize or not. And this
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,227.21,232.798,particular tree here is our candidate concept. So there's lots
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,232.798,234.722,and lots and lots of other trees that we might
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,234.722,237.82000000000002,have used. We might have used a tree that also
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,237.82,240.95999999999998,"took, asked questions about whether it was rainy or not"
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,240.96,243.19,or asked questions about whether you were on a hot
JDLcwBR8Odc,Representation Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,243.19,245.97,date or not. But we didn't. We picked a specific

qW3bOhW2W-s,Example 2: 20 Questions - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,198.37,201.32,"particular order. Right? So, here's a question I have"
qW3bOhW2W-s,Example 2: 20 Questions - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,201.32,203.37,for you. Why was the first question you
qW3bOhW2W-s,Example 2: 20 Questions - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,203.37,204.97,asked me whether it was an animal or not?
qW3bOhW2W-s,Example 2: 20 Questions - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,206.23,209.36999999999998,">> well, it seemed like I needed some way of"

qW3bOhW2W-s,Example 2: 20 Questions - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,212.33,216.38000000000002,as much information out of that question as I could
qW3bOhW2W-s,Example 2: 20 Questions - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,216.38,220.35999999999999,to try to make progress towards figuring who it actually was.
qW3bOhW2W-s,Example 2: 20 Questions - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,220.36,222.05,">> Right. So,"
qW3bOhW2W-s,Example 2: 20 Questions - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,222.05,227.74,"animal is the first question and it was because it narrowed things down. So,"
qW3bOhW2W-s,Example 2: 20 Questions - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,227.74,232.47,"your goal in asking questions was to narrow the possibilities, right?"
qW3bOhW2W-s,Example 2: 20 Questions - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,232.47,235.083,">> Sure, right because I only have 20 questions and"
qW3bOhW2W-s,Example 2: 20 Questions - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,235.083,237.428,"then I'm, you know I'm out of it, so if I"
qW3bOhW2W-s,Example 2: 20 Questions - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,237.428,241.046,"asked questions like You know, if I had said--started with,"
qW3bOhW2W-s,Example 2: 20 Questions - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,241.046,245.82999999999998,"Is it someone named Michael, that would have been really bizarre."
qW3bOhW2W-s,Example 2: 20 Questions - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,245.83,246.99,">> Right, and if the answer was no,"
qW3bOhW2W-s,Example 2: 20 Questions - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,246.99,248.55,it's not clear that it would tell you anything
qW3bOhW2W-s,Example 2: 20 Questions - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,248.55,251.27,"at all. So, actually, that's an interesting point. You started"
qW3bOhW2W-s,Example 2: 20 Questions - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,251.27,254.34,with animal; you could have started with Michael. And
qW3bOhW2W-s,Example 2: 20 Questions - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,254.34,256.85,"if I had said yes, that would have told you"
qW3bOhW2W-s,Example 2: 20 Questions - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,256.85,261.1,"something. But if I had said No, it wouldn't have told you hardly anything at"
qW3bOhW2W-s,Example 2: 20 Questions - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,261.1,266.99,"all. Right? So animal is a better attribute, or"
qW3bOhW2W-s,Example 2: 20 Questions - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,266.99,272.32,"feature, to ask about than Michael as a first question. Do you agree with that?"
qW3bOhW2W-s,Example 2: 20 Questions - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,272.32,274.46,">> Yeah, because it could have been like a stapler or something"
qW3bOhW2W-s,Example 2: 20 Questions - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,274.46,276.98999999999995,"like that and then I, the Michael question would've been pretty silly."
qW3bOhW2W-s,Example 2: 20 Questions - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,276.99,279.04,>> Exactly. So what about persons? So first you
qW3bOhW2W-s,Example 2: 20 Questions - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,279.04,281.63800000000003,asked about animal. Then you asked about person. Why person?
qW3bOhW2W-s,Example 2: 20 Questions - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,281.638,285.9,">> Right, because, because again it seemed like of the space of possibilities"
qW3bOhW2W-s,Example 2: 20 Questions - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,285.9,290.19,that I could think of person would help kind of again narrow things down.
qW3bOhW2W-s,Example 2: 20 Questions - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,290.19,293.09,"That I'd if it was the answer was yes, I would be able"
qW3bOhW2W-s,Example 2: 20 Questions - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,293.09,295.64,to focus there. If the answer was no I could focus some place else.
qW3bOhW2W-s,Example 2: 20 Questions - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,295.64,297.34999999999997,>> Exactly. And so I
qW3bOhW2W-s,Example 2: 20 Questions - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,297.35,300.51000000000005,"think in fact we could, we have a general statement here."
qW3bOhW2W-s,Example 2: 20 Questions - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,300.51,305.03,"That each one of these questions. Person, famous, do we know this"
qW3bOhW2W-s,Example 2: 20 Questions - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,305.03,309.2,"person, personally, so on and so forth. All make sense because they"
qW3bOhW2W-s,Example 2: 20 Questions - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,309.2,313.21999999999997,further narrow down the possibilities. And that bit about further is important.
qW3bOhW2W-s,Example 2: 20 Questions - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,319.04,322.72,Because it implies that the usefulness of a question
qW3bOhW2W-s,Example 2: 20 Questions - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,322.72,324.87,depends upon the answers that you got in the
qW3bOhW2W-s,Example 2: 20 Questions - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,324.87,327.9,previous questions. So even though Michael is not a
qW3bOhW2W-s,Example 2: 20 Questions - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,327.9,330.72999999999996,"particularly good first question to ask, it's a perfectly"

qW3bOhW2W-s,Example 2: 20 Questions - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,336.85,339.55,"this is an animal, a person, a famous person"

qW3bOhW2W-s,Example 2: 20 Questions - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,342.71,346.22999999999996,"music, etc., etc., etc. Okay, that make sense?"
qW3bOhW2W-s,Example 2: 20 Questions - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,346.23,346.81,>> Yeah.
qW3bOhW2W-s,Example 2: 20 Questions - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,346.81,352.08,">> Okay. So I think then, we have the hints of an algorithm. So let's"

nfWU1EwkwwU,Decision Trees Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,37.42,40.248000000000005,"you might ask me about. And what their,"
nfWU1EwkwwU,Decision Trees Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,40.248,43.01,what their attribute values are. What would be a

nfWU1EwkwwU,Decision Trees Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,51.09,52.82,so the first thing you did is you picked the best

nfWU1EwkwwU,Decision Trees Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,85.1,86.00999999999999,>> Okay.

nfWU1EwkwwU,Decision Trees Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,100.53,103.77,"You went back and pick the best attribute, asked the question, followed the"
nfWU1EwkwwU,Decision Trees Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,103.77,108.52,"answer path, so on, and so on, and you kept doing that until what?"
nfWU1EwkwwU,Decision Trees Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,110.12,114.95,">> Until, I narrowed the space of possibilities to,"
nfWU1EwkwwU,Decision Trees Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,114.95,116.47,"in this case, just one item."
nfWU1EwkwwU,Decision Trees Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,116.47,119.28,">> Right, so until you got to the answer. All right."
nfWU1EwkwwU,Decision Trees Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,120.92,124.60000000000001,"And that is an algorithm. So you pick the best attribute,"
nfWU1EwkwwU,Decision Trees Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,124.6,126.77,and you actually define what best attribute was. You want to
nfWU1EwkwwU,Decision Trees Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,126.77,129.26999999999998,pick one that would somehow eliminate at least half of the
nfWU1EwkwwU,Decision Trees Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,129.27,131.71,things which you might worry about and keep the other half
nfWU1EwkwwU,Decision Trees Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,131.71,135.84,in play. You asked a specific question. You followed the path
nfWU1EwkwwU,Decision Trees Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,135.84,137.85,to that and then you went back and you picked another
nfWU1EwkwwU,Decision Trees Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,137.85,140.17,attribute and so on and so forth until you got an answer
nfWU1EwkwwU,Decision Trees Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,140.17,143.11999999999998,that you wanted to. That's an algorithm and that's an
nfWU1EwkwwU,Decision Trees Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,143.12,146.33,algorithm that we might use to actually build a decision tree.
nfWU1EwkwwU,Decision Trees Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,146.33,149.3,And the only difference between what you did and what you
nfWU1EwkwwU,Decision Trees Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,149.3,151.54000000000002,"would do with learning a decision a tree is that, since"
nfWU1EwkwwU,Decision Trees Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,151.54,154.62,you don't know in advance what the answer actually is going
nfWU1EwkwwU,Decision Trees Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,154.62,158.03,"to be, because you don't know what specific object I might"
nfWU1EwkwwU,Decision Trees Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,158.03,162.46,"be thinking of, you have to actually follow all possible paths"
nfWU1EwkwwU,Decision Trees Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,162.46,165.6,at each time and think of all possible best next attributes
nfWU1EwkwwU,Decision Trees Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,165.6,168.85,until you completely can answer any question. Does that make sense?
nfWU1EwkwwU,Decision Trees Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,168.85,171.38,">> I see. So, right, so instead of"
nfWU1EwkwwU,Decision Trees Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,171.38,174.7,"just playing the game interactively, I kind of"
nfWU1EwkwwU,Decision Trees Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,174.7,176.64,imagine all possible ways it could go and
nfWU1EwkwwU,Decision Trees Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,176.64,179.5,"build that whole flow chart, that whole tree."
nfWU1EwkwwU,Decision Trees Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,180.68,185.01000000000002,">> Right, so, let's see if we can do that with some pictures"
nfWU1EwkwwU,Decision Trees Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,185.01,190.5,and I actually want to decide rather I really believe your definition of best.
nfWU1EwkwwU,Decision Trees Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,190.5,191.41,Okay?
nfWU1EwkwwU,Decision Trees Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,191.41,191.77,>> Sure.
nfWU1EwkwwU,Decision Trees Learning - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,191.77,192.64000000000001,">> Alright, so, let's do that."
LthbKTZEyNg,Best Attribute Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.902,2.719,"Alright, so let's take a moment to have a quiz where we"
LthbKTZEyNg,Best Attribute Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,2.719,5.939,really delve deeply into what it means to have a best attribute.
LthbKTZEyNg,Best Attribute Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,5.939,8.879999999999999,"So something Michael and I have been throwing around that term, let's"
LthbKTZEyNg,Best Attribute Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,8.88,11.38,"see if we can define it a little bit more crisply. So,"
LthbKTZEyNg,Best Attribute Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,11.38,15.43,what you have in front of you are three different attributes that
LthbKTZEyNg,Best Attribute Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,15.43,20.74,we might apply in our decision tree for sorting out our instances.
LthbKTZEyNg,Best Attribute Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,20.74,22.549999999999997,"So, at the top of the screen what you have is you"
LthbKTZEyNg,Best Attribute Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,22.55,27.12,have a cloud of instances. They are labelled either with red x or
LthbKTZEyNg,Best Attribute Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,27.12,31.18,"a green o, and that represents the label so that means"
LthbKTZEyNg,Best Attribute Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,31.18,32.955,"that they are part of our training set, so this is what"
LthbKTZEyNg,Best Attribute Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,32.955,36.71,"we're using to build and to learn our Decision Tree. So,"
LthbKTZEyNg,Best Attribute Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,36.71,40.278,in the first case you have the set of instances being sorted
LthbKTZEyNg,Best Attribute Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,40.278,43.39,into two piles. There are some xs and some os on
LthbKTZEyNg,Best Attribute Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,43.39,46.02,the left and some xs and some os on the right. And
LthbKTZEyNg,Best Attribute Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,46.02,49.56,the second case you have that same set of data being
LthbKTZEyNg,Best Attribute Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,49.56,52.24,sorted so that all of it goes to the left and none
LthbKTZEyNg,Best Attribute Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,52.24,56.32,of it goes to the right. And in the third case you have that same set of
LthbKTZEyNg,Best Attribute Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,56.32,59.35,data that's sorted so that a bunch of the xs end up on the left and a
LthbKTZEyNg,Best Attribute Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,59.35,64.0,"bunch of the os end up on the right. What I want you to do is to rank each one,"
LthbKTZEyNg,Best Attribute Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,64.0,70.65,where one is the best and three is the least best attribute to choose. Go.
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.9,3.77,"Okay Michael. So, are you ready to give me a ranking"
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,3.77,5.779999999999999,">> Yes, yes, I think I am."
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,5.78,7.470000000000001,">> Okay, well, if you give me a ranking then."
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,7.47,9.91,">> So, did you say one was the best."
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,9.91,13.91,">> One is the best and three is the least best. Alright, so I"
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,13.91,16.9,am really excited about the third cloud
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,16.9,18.79,structure. The third attribute to be split
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,18.79,22.21,"on. Because, what it does. Is it takes all our x's and o's That"
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,22.21,23.75,need to have different labels and it
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,23.75,25.93,puts them into two different buckets. One where
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,25.93,28.34,they all get to be red x's and the other where they all get to
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,28.34,31.36,be green o's. So I would say the far right one is ranked number one.
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,31.36,36.93,>> I would agree with you and in fact I would say that infact we're done.
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,36.93,37.95,">> Yeah, it's perfect."
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,37.95,41.57,">> It is perfect, agreed. One is perfect. Or 3"
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,41.57,43.63,"is perfect in this case, because I gave it a one."
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,43.63,47.89,">> Alright, so then, I think the worst one is also"
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,47.89,51.81,"easy to pick, because if you look at the middle attribute,"
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,51.81,55.400000000000006,"the attribute that's shown in the middle, we take all the data, and we put"
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,55.4,58.89,it all on the left. So we really have just kicked the can down the
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,58.89,62.05,road a little bit. There's nothing. That
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,62.05,67.02,"this attribute splitting has done. So, I would"
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,67.02,68.97,call that the worst possible thing you could
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,68.97,70.66,do. Which is to basically to do nothing.
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,70.66,75.22,">> No, I think that's right. and, in fact, it really is doing nothing."
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,76.47,76.73,>> Right.
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,76.73,78.64,>> Okay. So
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,78.64,80.19,what about the first attribute?
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,80.19,83.14999999999999,">> So, I'm going to put that at, you know,"
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,83.15,85.13000000000001,if the first one is too hot and the middle
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,85.13,87.57,"one is too cold, I would say this one is,"
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,87.57,90.36999999999999,"wait, no, no. [LAUGH] I was going down the Goldilocks"
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,90.37,93.32000000000001,"path. So, so this one is sort of in between."
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,93.32,97.57,In that it splits things so you have smaller sets
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,97.57,100.44999999999999,"of data to deal with, but it hasn't really improved"
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,100.45,104.23,our ability to tell the reds and the greens apart.
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,104.23,109.65,"So in fact, I'd almost want to put this as three also but I'll put it as two."
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,109.65,114.36,>> Okay. I think an argument could be making it three. An argument could be
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,114.36,118.67,"made for making it two. Your point is actually pretty good, right? We have eight"
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,118.67,121.10000000000001,red things and eight green things up
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,121.1,124.55999999999999,"here. And the kind of distribution between them,"
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,124.56,126.84,"sort of half red and, half red x's,"
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,126.84,129.33,"half green o's, we have the same distribution"
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,129.33,131.5,after we go through this attribute here. So it does some
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,131.5,134.18,"splitting, but it's still, well you still end up with half"
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,134.18,137.12,"red, half green, half x, half o. So, that's not a"
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,137.12,140.51,"lot of help, but it's certainly better than doing absolutely nothing."
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,140.51,141.95999999999998,">> Well is it though? I mean, it seems"
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,141.96,144.81,it could also be the case. That what we've done
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,144.81,147.4,is that we're now splitting on that has provided
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,147.4,150.95000000000002,"no valid information, and therefore can only contribute to overfitting."
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,150.95,152.42,>> That's that's a good point. That's a
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,152.42,154.42,"good point. So, do you want to change your answer"
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,154.42,154.78,to three?
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,154.78,157.98,">> I don't know, what did you want the answer to be? It seems"
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,157.98,161.51999999999998,to me that the first one and the second one are just plain bad.
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,161.52,162.73000000000002,>> They are just plain bad. The question
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,162.73,164.54999999999998,"is whether one is, more bad than the other."
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,164.55,166.5,">> I, I don't know. I don't know how to judge."
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,166.5,167.75,">> Well I'll tell you, I would accept"
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,167.75,169.86,either two or a three as an answer here.
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,169.86,171.20000000000002,I think you can make an argument either
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,171.2,173.17,way. And I think you actually made both arguments.
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,173.17,174.26999999999998,>> That's very nice of you.
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,174.27,174.33,>> So.
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,174.33,174.67000000000002,>> Thank you.
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,174.67,177.17,>> You're very welcome. So this is perfect. This
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,177.17,179.55999999999997,is the House of Representatives and this is the Senate.
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,179.56,183.72,">> [LAUGH] What do you mean they're? Oh. So, there you go. Okay."
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,183.72,187.22,">> [LAUGH] Not exactly sure what you mean,"
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,187.22,190.46,but it seems somehow denigrating to our political system.
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,190.46,192.62,">> It is not at all denigrating. It is,"
R0OA5e1tFhA,Best Attribute Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,192.62,195.57,"it is, I would call it incisive political satire."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.26,2.9400000000000004,"Okay.
So Michael, for the last 15 minutes or"
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,2.94,7.699999999999999,"so we've been talking about decision
trees, sort of in the abstract without"
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,7.7,10.690000000000001,"saying too much about the kinds of
functions they can actually represent."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,10.69,14.049999999999999,"So, for the next few minutes or so I
want to talk a little bit about not just"
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,14.05,18.57,"decision trees in the abstract, but
exactly how expressive they can be."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,18.57,19.46,"Is that okay?
>> Yeah,"
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,19.46,21.28,I think that would be really helpful.
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,21.28,21.98,>> I think so too.
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,21.98,24.15,"So in fact, I want to look
at a set of functions, and"
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,24.15,27.09,"in particular I'm interested in
looking at Boolean functions."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,28.45,29.84,>> Boolean.
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,29.84,32.24,">> So what's your favorite
simple Boolean function?"
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,32.24,33.17,>> Implication.

simple boolean function?"
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,35.25,37.94,>> Well I like Nor.
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,37.94,38.5,">> Right.
So what I"
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,38.5,41.19,"just heard you say is you like And,
so let's do that one."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,41.19,41.8,">> Oh, that's great."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,41.8,42.529999999999994,That is my favorite.
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,43.57,44.08,>> All right.
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,44.08,45.8,"So, in fact, let's do very simple And."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,45.8,47.25,"So, how does And work, right?"
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,47.25,49.36,"So, you've got two attributes."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,49.36,50.56,Let's say A and B.
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,51.85,56.42,"And, this expression,
A and B, is true when?"
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,56.42,57.6,>> When A and B are true.
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,57.6,59.861000000000004,"When they are both
true at the same time."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,59.861,60.660999999999994,">> Right, exactly."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,60.661,63.346000000000004,"So, how would you build a decision tree,"
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,63.346,69.25,"given that there are only two attribute,
A and B, to represent that function?"
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,69.25,71.0,">> Okay so
I'd have a note that's A and B."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,72.02,73.441,"And if that's true.
>> Nope, you're not allowed to do that."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,73.441,74.75,>> Oh.
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,74.75,77.47,">> Every node can be,
have at most one attribute."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,77.47,80.39,">> All right well let's
let's put A in an attribute."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,81.82,83.30999999999999,">> Okay, so here's a little node."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,83.31,85.52,Let's call it A.
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,85.52,86.56,">> Okay.
>> Now what?"
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,86.56,87.78,">> And well I mean, for"
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,87.78,89.68,"it to be a node it needs to have
the little two branchy things."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,90.75,91.49,True and false.
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,91.49,91.99,>> Okay.
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,93.16,95.97999999999999,"All right, so how about true on
the left and false on the right?"
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,97.06,98.41,">> Sure, as long as you label them."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,98.41,99.02,"So, all right."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,99.02,102.11999999999999,"So then A, if A is true,
okay, I don't know."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,102.12,106.86,"But oh, but if A is false,
then we know that A and B must be false."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,106.86,108.03,Doesn't matter what B is.
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,108.03,109.4,So we can just put a leaf under the F.
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,109.4,109.9,>> That's correct.
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,111.02,111.86,"All right, I like that."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,111.86,112.89,>> Okay.
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,112.89,113.95,What about when A is true?
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,113.95,114.78,">> What, is that an F?"
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,116.02,117.643,">> That is an F, and
that is a minus sign for false."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,117.643,118.271,">> Oh, a minus sign."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,118.271,118.853,"I get it, okay."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,118.853,121.8,"I thought you were just not
done drawing the F yet."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,121.8,122.75,">> good.
All right."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,122.75,123.55,"So, oh yeah."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,123.55,125.17999999999999,"On the true side then,
I don't think we know."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,125.18,127.85000000000001,So I think we need to split on B also.
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,127.85,128.69899999999998,>> Okay.
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,128.699,129.96,>> So put a little B under there.
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,129.96,131.34,">> All right, done."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,131.34,133.768,">> All right, and
then true-false split on B."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,137.638,139.5,"All right and so
now we've got these two cases."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,139.5,143.41,"So if B is false, then again,
it doesn't matter what A was but"
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,143.41,144.56,A turns out to be true.
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,144.56,147.47,"But it's still the, the, it should
be a minus sign underneath that."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,148.54,149.12,>> Okay.
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,149.12,151.11,>> So it's not A and B is not true.
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,151.11,154.61,"But if A is true and
B is true then A and B is true."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,154.61,156.24,"So there should be
a plus sign on the left."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,157.41,158.245,>> That's exactly right.
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,158.245,159.59,>> Woo.
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,159.59,161.85,">> So clearly decision trees proof by,"
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,161.85,165.72,"we just drew it here,
can represent the Boolean function And."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,165.72,166.634,">> Sure.
>> [CROSSTALK]."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,166.634,169.712,">> You said something int,
you said something interesting, Michael."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,169.712,172.31,"You said it doesn't matter
what A is if B is false."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,172.31,178.92000000000002,"So what would happen if I switch,
A and B around."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,178.92,179.61999999999998,>> That's the same.
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,179.62,183.0,"So if B, okay, in the beginning,
we say, if B is false, it's false."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,183.0,184.91,"If B is true, we check A."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,184.91,186.42,"If A is false, then it's false."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,186.42,188.75,"But if A is true, then it's true."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,188.75,192.18,"So it actually still represents
exactly the same function, A and B."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,192.18,195.53,"Oh, because A and B is collaborative."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,195.53,197.58,"No, commutative."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,197.58,199.02,"Yes?
No?"
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,199.02,200.54000000000002,"Hello?
>> It's one of those things."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,200.54,201.20999999999998,It's commutative.
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,201.21,202.99,As opposed to associative.
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,202.99,203.56,>> As opposed to what?
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,204.62,205.28,>> Associative.
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,205.28,206.45,">> Well I mean it, it's that too."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,206.45,208.82999999999998,"But I mean, it's the reason that you
can just switch those two things and"
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,208.83,211.48000000000002,"it didn't make a difference is because
they play the same role in the function."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,212.48,216.17,">> That's true in, in terms of
representation of the decision trees."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,216.17,218.47,"You know, it doesn't really matter
which attribute you pick or"
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,218.47,219.45,the order in which you do them.
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,219.45,222.82,"You might get a better tree or a worse
tree or a longer tree or a shorter tree."
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,222.82,225.79,"But for something simple like,
two valued And,"
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,225.79,227.2,it really just doesn't matter.
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,227.2,228.60999999999999,>> Okay.
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,228.61,229.38000000000002,">> kind of neat, huh?"
-9TdpdjDtAM,Decision Trees Expressiveness AND - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,229.38,229.88,>> Yeah.
drna_Y3YNH0,Decision Trees Expressiveness OR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.0,1.229,"Okay, so we can do A and B."
drna_Y3YNH0,Decision Trees Expressiveness OR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,1.229,3.5100000000000002,"So, let's pick another function."
drna_Y3YNH0,Decision Trees Expressiveness OR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,3.51,7.162,"What's your other favorite,
Boolean function of two variables?"
drna_Y3YNH0,Decision Trees Expressiveness OR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,7.162,10.267,">> Well, if we're doing two attributes,
you know, or"
drna_Y3YNH0,Decision Trees Expressiveness OR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,10.267,11.991999999999999,is the other really nice one.
drna_Y3YNH0,Decision Trees Expressiveness OR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,11.992,12.585,>> I like or.
drna_Y3YNH0,Decision Trees Expressiveness OR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,12.585,13.106000000000002,"So, let's see."
drna_Y3YNH0,Decision Trees Expressiveness OR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,13.106,17.123,"Do you think, now that we've shown that
we can do A and B, could we do A or B?"
drna_Y3YNH0,Decision Trees Expressiveness OR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,17.123,19.781000000000002,>> I feel like we could do A or B.
drna_Y3YNH0,Decision Trees Expressiveness OR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,19.781,23.781,"because there's that nice De Morgen's
Law relationship between them but but"
drna_Y3YNH0,Decision Trees Expressiveness OR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,23.781,27.246,"let's just, how about this,
can you erase the tags at the bottom?"
drna_Y3YNH0,Decision Trees Expressiveness OR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,27.246,28.302999999999997,>> Like that?
drna_Y3YNH0,Decision Trees Expressiveness OR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,28.303,31.704,">> Oh, yeah but
that's not going to work, is it?"
drna_Y3YNH0,Decision Trees Expressiveness OR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,31.704,34.14,"So, so if B and A are both true, so"
drna_Y3YNH0,Decision Trees Expressiveness OR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,34.14,38.508,"the left branch, then the,
the, the leaf should be plus?"
drna_Y3YNH0,Decision Trees Expressiveness OR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,38.508,39.425000000000004,>> Yes.

to use exactly the same thing."
drna_Y3YNH0,Decision Trees Expressiveness OR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,59.486,60.727999999999994,So let's just erase it.
drna_Y3YNH0,Decision Trees Expressiveness OR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,60.728,61.888,>> All right.
drna_Y3YNH0,Decision Trees Expressiveness OR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,61.888,62.945,>> And start from scratch.
drna_Y3YNH0,Decision Trees Expressiveness OR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,62.945,64.709,"So what would you do
starting from scratch?"
drna_Y3YNH0,Decision Trees Expressiveness OR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,64.709,66.602,>> I'd split on B again.
drna_Y3YNH0,Decision Trees Expressiveness OR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,66.602,70.549,>> Okay.
drna_Y3YNH0,Decision Trees Expressiveness OR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,70.549,71.86200000000001,>> True False or False True.
drna_Y3YNH0,Decision Trees Expressiveness OR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,71.862,72.50099999999999,>> True False.
drna_Y3YNH0,Decision Trees Expressiveness OR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,72.501,75.42500000000001,>> True False.
drna_Y3YNH0,Decision Trees Expressiveness OR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,75.425,77.505,">> All right, and now if B is true."
drna_Y3YNH0,Decision Trees Expressiveness OR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,77.505,80.58,"We know that A or B is true, so
we can put a plus under the left side."
drna_Y3YNH0,Decision Trees Expressiveness OR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,80.58,81.684,>> Right.
drna_Y3YNH0,Decision Trees Expressiveness OR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,81.684,83.146,>> But if B is false.
drna_Y3YNH0,Decision Trees Expressiveness OR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,83.146,84.063,>> Mm-hm.
drna_Y3YNH0,Decision Trees Expressiveness OR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,84.063,84.98,>> Then we need to split on A.
drna_Y3YNH0,Decision Trees Expressiveness OR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,84.98,87.36,>> Okay.
drna_Y3YNH0,Decision Trees Expressiveness OR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,87.36,91.249,">> And if A is true, then we're golden,
we get the Or is true."
drna_Y3YNH0,Decision Trees Expressiveness OR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,91.249,94.942,"And if A is false, then it is false."

drna_Y3YNH0,Decision Trees Expressiveness OR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,101.941,102.60300000000001,>> Right.
drna_Y3YNH0,Decision Trees Expressiveness OR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,102.603,108.10499999999999,"What happens if I swap A and
B around, does it still work?"
drna_Y3YNH0,Decision Trees Expressiveness OR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,108.105,112.147,">> I mean, my, my, since they're
collaborative or commutative."
drna_Y3YNH0,Decision Trees Expressiveness OR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,112.147,115.11500000000001,"Since they're commutative I want to say
it shouldn't make a difference, but"
drna_Y3YNH0,Decision Trees Expressiveness OR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,115.115,116.36,let's just double check that.
drna_Y3YNH0,Decision Trees Expressiveness OR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,116.36,118.044,So if A is true then the output's true.
drna_Y3YNH0,Decision Trees Expressiveness OR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,118.044,121.143,"If A is false and
B is true then the output's true."

drna_Y3YNH0,Decision Trees Expressiveness OR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,126.065,128.863,"And, you know, if I hadn't erased
it you would see that the two trees"

drna_Y3YNH0,Decision Trees Expressiveness OR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,130.465,131.546,">> They're sort of mirror each,
of each other."
drna_Y3YNH0,Decision Trees Expressiveness OR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,131.546,132.417,>> If you just swapped around.

DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,12.1,14.35,">> Okay.
XOR is exclusive or,"

DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,70.522,73.01,">> Or, because it's a lot like or."
DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,73.01,74.96000000000001,">> So, what would you want to do?"
DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,74.96,76.92999999999999,">> Okay, so to do XOR,
we can split on A."
DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,76.93,77.43,>> Okay.
DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,79.67,81.42,">> And there's a true branch and
a false branch."
DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,82.73,85.18,"And what happened with and
and or at this point is,"
DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,85.18,87.35000000000001,"there is at least one branch where
we actually knew the answer,"
DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,87.35,89.31599999999999,"at this point, but
I don't think that's true here."
DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,89.316,91.85000000000001,>> That's right.
DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,91.85,94.05999999999999,">> So, so if A is true,
the output might be true or false."
DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,94.06,95.49000000000001,It depends on B.
DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,95.49,98.30999999999999,"And if A is false,
the output might be False or True."
DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,98.31,98.91,It depends on B.
DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,100.14,100.96,"So I-
>> This is exactly right."
DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,100.96,106.11999999999999,"So I guess in both cases we
still have to split on B."
DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,106.12,106.85000000000001,">> Okay.
All right."
DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,106.85,109.80999999999999,"So, now it should be relatively easy in"
DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,109.81,115.12,"the sense that there's a separate
leaf for all possible inputs."
DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,115.12,117.32000000000001,"And so we can just write
the XOR function on the bottom."
DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,117.32,121.27,"So if A and B are both true, then the
output is false because it's exclusive."
DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,122.31,126.60000000000001,"If A is true and B is false, then it
should be true, because A is true."
DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,127.86,130.65,"If A is false and B is true, then it
should be true because B is true."
DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,132.73,135.09,"And if A and B are both false
then it should be false."
DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,136.52,137.22,>> That's right.
DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,137.22,138.79,"And by the way,
if you were to think about it for"
DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,138.79,141.48,"a little while, it would probably
occur to you that's this tree is"
DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,141.48,143.91899999999998,"just a another representation
of the full truth table."
DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,145.2,145.7,>> Very nice.
DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,147.0,151.032,">> And in fact, if we wanted to do or
again, we could say,"
DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,151.032,156.40300000000002,"well I was very smart last time, but
I could actually write or like this."
DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,162.377,164.57000000000002,"And then just fill out
the values at the bottom."
DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,164.57,167.42,"If A is true and B is true, then yes."
DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,167.42,169.79,"If A is true and B is false, then yes."

DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,174.87,180.02,"And this is a perfectly legitimate a
decision tree to represent or because it"
DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,180.02,184.07000000000002,"basically is just another simple
representation of the truth table,"
DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,184.07,186.65,"but as we pointed out
when did last time,"
DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,186.65,188.68,"it's more of a decision
tree than we actually need."
DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,191.02,192.5,>> I can see that.
DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,192.5,195.449,">> Because in particular,
we don't actually need this."
DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,197.08,197.69000000000003,All right.
DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,197.69,201.44,"So this little difference here between
writing out the entire truth table on"
DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,201.44,204.93,"the left, as we did for XOR, and not
having to write out the entire decision"

or with more attributes that we did for"
DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,213.88,215.34,"the simple and, or, and XOR."
DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,215.34,217.61,Would you like to see?
DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,217.61,218.88000000000002,">> Yeah, that sounds really cool."
DFuFDfu-H4E,Decision Trees Expressiveness XOR - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,218.88,219.38,>> Beautiful.
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.34,2.895,">> So, we saw before when we looked at AND and"
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,2.895,5.377000000000001,OR versus XOR that in the case of AND and OR
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,5.377,8.077,we only needed two nodes but in the case of XOR
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,8.077,11.928,we needed three. The difference between two and three is not that
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,11.928,14.474,"big, but it actually does turn out to be big if"
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,14.474,18.986,"you start thinking about having more than simply two attributes. So, let's"
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,18.986,22.85,look at generalized versions of OR and generalized versions of XOR
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,22.85,25.541,and see if we can see how the size of the decision
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,25.541,33.13,tree grows differently. So in the case of an n version of OR. That is we have n
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,33.13,35.730000000000004,attributes as opposed to just two. We might call
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,35.73,40.31999999999999,that the any function. That is a function were any
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,40.32,42.7,of the variables are true then the output is
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,42.7,45.11,true. We can see that the decision tree for that
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,45.11,48.54,has a very particular and kind of interesting form.
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,48.54,51.43,Any ideas Michael about what that decision tree looks like?
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,51.43,53.8,">> So, well. So going off of the way you described"
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,53.8,56.55,OR in the two case. We can start with that. And you.
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,56.55,61.48,You pick Pick one of the variables. And if its true
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,61.48,64.7,then yeah. Any of them is true since the leaf is true.
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,64.7,66.5,>> What happens if its false?
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,66.5,71.97,">> Well, then we have to check what everything that's left. [LAUGH]"
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,71.97,74.47,So then we move on to one of the other attributes like A2.
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,74.47,75.05,>> mm hm.
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,75.05,76.90299999999999,">> And again, if it's"
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,76.903,82.18,"true, it's true and if it's false then we don't know."
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,82.18,84.60000000000001,>> Look at A3.
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,84.6,86.38,>> Good idea.
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,89.07,90.82,This could take some time.
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,90.82,93.21,">> Yes, oh that was actually an interesting point. Let's"
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,93.21,97.27,"say if there were only three, we would be done. Right?"
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,97.27,98.95,>> Right.
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,98.95,100.59,">> But wait, what if there were five?"
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,100.59,102.0,>> Then we need one more node.
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,103.13,104.25999999999999,>> What if there were n?
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,104.26,105.96000000000001,>> Then we need n minus 4 more nodes.
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,107.52,109.25999999999999,">> Right, so what you end up with in"
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,109.26,114.08000000000001,this case is a nice little structure around the
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,114.08,116.63,decision tree. And how many nodes do we need?
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,117.9,120.09,">> Looks like one for each attribute, so that would be n."
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,120.09,125.04,">> n nodes, exactly right. So we have a term for this"
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,125.04,129.35,"sort of thing, the size of the decision tree is, in fact, linear."
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,132.45,136.31,In n. And that's for any. Now what about an n version of XOR?
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,136.31,144.75,">> Mm. So XOR is, if one is true but the other one's not true then it's true."
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,144.75,146.56,And if they're both true. Yeah I don't. It's
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,146.56,149.96,not clear headed. Generalize that. So why not hmm.
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,149.96,152.84,">> So, while the usual general version of this we like"
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,152.84,157.47,"to think of as parity. All parity is a way of counting,"
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,157.47,160.82,so there's usual two forms of parity that we worry about. Either
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,160.82,164.85,"even parity or odd parity. So let's pick one, it doesn't matter."
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,167.25,168.28,Let's say.
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,168.28,168.77,>> Odd.
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,168.77,171.78,">> I like that, we'll do odd parity. And all that"
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,171.78,174.39000000000001,"works out to be in this case is, if the number"
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,174.39,178.35999999999999,"of attributes that are true is an odd number, then the"
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,178.36,182.24,"output of the function is true, otherwise it's false. Got it?"
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,182.24,183.26000000000002,>> Got it.
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,183.26,186.06,">> Okay, so, how would we make that decision tree work?"
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,186.06,192.37,">> Ooh. Well, we got to split on something and there all the same, so let's"
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,192.37,193.34,split on A1 again.
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,193.34,193.85,>> Okay.
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,196.28,200.08,"So what do we do if A1 is true, versus being false."
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,200.08,206.73000000000002,>> We don't know much if A1 is true. We have to look at everybody else.
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,206.73,214.79,>> Right. So let's look at A2. What if A2 is true versus false?
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,214.79,217.57999999999998,">> Well if A1 and A2 are true then, then the output is going to be"

KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,220.35,221.6,are. So you still have to do that.
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,221.6,225.17,">> Uh-huh, yup. And I'm already running out of room,"
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,225.17,228.17,so let's pretend there's only three variables. What's the output?
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,228.17,231.39999999999998,">> [LAUGH] All right, so the far left. Is there's"
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,231.4,233.66,three trues which is odd so the output is true.
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,233.66,234.18,>> Yep.
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,234.18,241.56,">> The next leaf over, only two trues. A1 is true, A2 is true,"
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,241.56,245.43,"but A3 is false, so that's two trues which is is even so the answer's false."
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,245.43,247.1,>> Um-huh.
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,247.1,248.164,">> Is this going to, is this pattern"
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,248.164,249.91,"continuing? Now we've got. No, so then it's"
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,249.91,252.835,false again because we've got two trues and a false to get to the next leaf.
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,252.835,253.675,>> Mm-hm.

KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,255.66,259.61,"next leaf so that's true. Oh, that looks like XOR."
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,259.61,262.1,">> It looks just like XOR. In fact, each"
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,262.1,263.86,one of these sub trees is kind of a version

KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,270.02,273.22999999999996,"So we gotta redo A2, and we're going to be in the same"

KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,290.65,295.48999999999995,"Okay, so in the case where only A3 is true, it's true and"

KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,377.3,381.38,difficult problem. There is no clever way to pick the right
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,381.38,383.56,attributes in order to give you an answer. You have to

KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,390.37,393.39,"want to make, is that we hope that in our machine"
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,393.39,397.08,learning problems we're looking at things that are more like any

KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,407.04,408.67,be particularly clever about how we do it.
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,408.67,411.53000000000003,">> Though, if we were kind of clever and added another attribute,"

KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,415.15,418.33099999999996,"would make it not so bad again. So maybe it's just a,"
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,418.331,421.53000000000003,"it's just a kind of, bad way of writing the problem down."

KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,423.632,425.23,is that the hardest problem is coming up with
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,425.23,427.49,a good representation. So what you just did
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,427.49,429.82,"is, you came up with a better representation,"
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,429.82,431.78499999999997,"where you created some new pair, new variable."

KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,439.0,441.71,true is one and false is zero. This is actually a really good
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,441.71,446.37,idea. It's also called cheating. [LAUGH] Because you [LAUGH] got to solve the
KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,446.37,449.98,problem by picking the best representation in the first place. But you know

KwMaBd3UitA,Decision Tree Expressiveness - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,457.09,459.34,throughout all the rest of the lessons. What's the best way to cheat?
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.71,3.2199999999999998,">> All right, so what that last little exercise showed is"

te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,8.33,10.97,"provides us a little bit of a hint, right? We know that"
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,10.97,13.850000000000001,XOR is hard and we know that OR is easy. At least
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,13.85,16.419999999999998,"in terms of the number of nodes you need, right? But, we"
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,16.42,20.110000000000003,"don't know, going in, what a particular function is. So we never"
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,20.11,22.36,know whether the decision tree that we're going to have to build
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,22.36,25.65,"is going to be an easy one. That is something linear, say."
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,25.65,29.009999999999998,"Or a hard one, something that's exponential. So this brings me"
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,29.01,32.509,"to a key question that I want to ask, which is,"
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,32.509,36.17,exactly how expressive is a decision tree. And this is what
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,36.17,38.186,I really mean by this. Not just what kind of functions
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,38.186,41.58,"it kind of represent. But, if we're going to be searching over"
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,41.58,44.64,"all possible decision trees in order to find the right one,"
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,44.64,47.87,how many decision trees do we have to worry about to
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,47.87,50.73,"look at? So, let's go back and look at, take the XOR"
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,50.73,53.651999999999994,case again and just speak more generally. Let's imagine that we
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,53.652,57.75,"once again, we have n attributes. Here's my question to you, Michael."
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,57.75,60.56,"How many decision trees are there? And look, I'm going to make"
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,60.56,61.7,"it easy for you, Michael. They're"
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,61.7,64.39,"not just attributes, they're Boolean attributes."
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,64.39,66.59,>> Thanks.
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,66.59,69.95,">> Okay? And they're not just Boolean attributes,"
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,69.95,74.13,but the output is also Boolean. Got it?
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,74.13,75.72999999999999,>> Sure. But how
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,75.73,80.38000000000001,"many trees? So it's, I'm going to go with a lot."
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,80.38,83.94999999999999,>> Okay. A lot. Define a lot.
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,83.95,87.32000000000001,">> Define a lot. So, alright, well, there's"
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,87.32,91.83,n choices for which node to split on first.
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,91.83,92.92,>> Yeah.
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,92.92,96.89,">> And then, for each of those, there's n minus 1 to split"
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,96.89,100.47,on next. So I feel like that could be an n factorial kind of thing.
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,100.47,102.27,>> Maybe. I
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,102.27,102.67,like that.
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,102.67,105.59,">> And then, even after we've done all that,"
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,105.59,108.76,then we have an exponential number of leaves. And for
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,108.76,111.31,"each of those leaves, we could fill in either true"
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,111.31,114.87,or false. So it's going to be exponential in that too.
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,114.87,117.43,">> Hm, so let me see if I got that right."
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,117.43,119.88000000000001,So you said we have to pick each attribute at every
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,119.88,122.77,level. And so you see something that you think is probably
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,122.77,127.06,"going to be, you know? Some kind of commutatorial question here."
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,127.06,129.3,"So, let's say n factorial, and that's going"
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,129.3,131.32000000000002,to just build the nodes. That's just the nodes.
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,134.41,138.063,"Well, once you have the nodes, you still have to figure out the answers."
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,141.04,146.23999999999998,"And so, this is exponential because factorial is exponential. And"
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,146.24,150.10000000000002,this is also exponential. Huh. So let's see if we can
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,150.1,152.04,write that down. So let me propose a way to think
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,152.04,154.226,"about this, Michael. You're exactly right the way you're thinking. So,"
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,154.226,156.382,let's see if we can be a little bit more concrete
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,156.382,159.387,"about it. So, we have Boolean inputs and we have Boolean"
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,159.387,162.348,"outputs, so this is just like AND, it's just like OR,"
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,162.348,166.443,"it's just like XOR, so, whenever we're dealing with Boolean functions,"
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,166.443,169.62,we can write down a truth table. So let's think about what the truth
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,169.62,171.744,table looks like in this case. [SOUND]
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,171.744,174.11,"Alright, so, let's look at the truth table."
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,176.18,179.46,"So what a truth table will give me is,"
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,179.46,182.04000000000002,"for, the way a truth table normally works is"
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,182.04,184.89,"you write out, each of the attributes. So, attribute"
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,184.89,190.17999999999998,"one, attribute two, attribute three, and dot dot dot."
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,190.18,194.07,"And there's n of those, okay? We did this"
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,194.07,197.01999999999998,a little earlier. When we did our decision tree.
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,198.13,201.24,When we tried to figure out whether I was on a hot date or not. And then you
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,201.24,204.23000000000002,"have some kind of output or answer. So,"
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,204.23,205.76999999999998,each of these attributes could take on true
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,205.77,210.745,or false. So one kind of input that we may get would be say all trues.
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,213.66,217.82999999999998,"Right? But we also might get all trues, except"
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,217.83,220.43,for one false at the end. Or maybe the
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,220.43,222.4,first one's false and all the rest of them
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,222.4,225.38,"are true, and so on, and so forth. And"
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,225.38,229.57999999999998,each one of those possibilites is another row in
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,229.58,232.47,our table. And that can just go on for
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,232.47,234.44,we don't know how long. So we have any
te5K2prTrhE,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,234.44,237.31,number of rows here and my question to you is

z98Lr7105IM,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz 2 Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,34.51,35.446,>> No.
z98Lr7105IM,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz 2 Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,35.446,36.476,>> Okay.
z98Lr7105IM,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz 2 Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,36.476,38.653,>> But you're right. It's 2 to the 2
z98Lr7105IM,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz 2 Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,38.653,42.53,to the n. So it's a double exponential and
z98Lr7105IM,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz 2 Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,42.53,50.82,it's not the same thing as 4 to the nth. It's actually 2 to the 2 to the nth.
z98Lr7105IM,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz 2 Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,50.82,52.65,Now how big of a number do you think that is Michael?
z98Lr7105IM,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz 2 Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,52.65,57.25,>> I'm going to go again to my go to place and just say a lot.
z98Lr7105IM,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz 2 Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,57.25,58.81,">> It is, in fact, a lot and I'm"
z98Lr7105IM,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz 2 Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,58.81,60.64,"going, I actually, I'm going to look over here, and I'm"
z98Lr7105IM,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz 2 Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,60.64,64.93,going to tell you. That for even a small value
z98Lr7105IM,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz 2 Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,64.93,67.74000000000001,"of n, this gets to be a really big number."
z98Lr7105IM,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz 2 Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,67.74,71.74,">> So for, for one, it's 2 to the 2"
z98Lr7105IM,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz 2 Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,71.74,74.22999999999999,"to the 1, which is 4. That's not a big number."
z98Lr7105IM,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz 2 Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,74.23,75.69,>> That's true. What about two?
z98Lr7105IM,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz 2 Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,75.69,76.64,>> For
z98Lr7105IM,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz 2 Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,76.64,80.3,"two, it's 2 to the 2 to the 2. So 2 to"
z98Lr7105IM,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz 2 Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,80.3,83.07,"the 2 is 4, so it's 2 to the 4, which is 16."
z98Lr7105IM,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz 2 Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,83.07,84.85,>> What about three?
z98Lr7105IM,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz 2 Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,84.85,88.47999999999999,">> Alright, so that's two to the 8th, which is 256?"
z98Lr7105IM,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz 2 Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,88.48,92.35000000000001,">> Mm-hm. So that's growing pretty fast, don't you think?"
z98Lr7105IM,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz 2 Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,92.35,94.41,">> Sure, but those aren't big numbers yet."
z98Lr7105IM,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz 2 Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,94.41,98.11999999999999,">> What if I told you, [LAUGH] that for n equals"
z98Lr7105IM,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz 2 Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,98.12,102.14800000000001,"6, 2 to the 2 to the n was, I'm going to start"
z98Lr7105IM,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz 2 Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,102.148,112.148,"writing it, okay? 18466744073709551616."
z98Lr7105IM,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz 2 Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,122.302,123.599,>> Holy monkeys.
z98Lr7105IM,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz 2 Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,123.599,126.863,">> Yes, that is in fact the technical term for this number,"
z98Lr7105IM,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz 2 Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,126.863,130.038,"it's a holy monkey. It is a very, very big number."
z98Lr7105IM,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz 2 Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,130.038,132.12,So 2 to the n grows very fast. We already called
z98Lr7105IM,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz 2 Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,132.12,134.15,that evil. 2 to the 2 to the n is a
z98Lr7105IM,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz 2 Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,134.15,137.66,"double exponential and it's super evil. It grows very, very, very,"
z98Lr7105IM,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz 2 Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,137.66,140.93,"very, very fast. So what's the point of this exercise, Michael?"
z98Lr7105IM,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz 2 Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,140.93,144.81,"It's, it's to point that the space of decision trees, the"
z98Lr7105IM,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz 2 Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,144.81,148.81,"hypothesis space that we've chosen, is very expressive because there's lots"
z98Lr7105IM,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz 2 Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,148.81,152.47,of different functions that you can represent. But that also means
z98Lr7105IM,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz 2 Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,152.47,154.45,we have to have some clever way to search
z98Lr7105IM,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz 2 Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,154.45,157.14999999999998,among them. And that gets us back to our
z98Lr7105IM,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz 2 Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,157.15,160.05,notion of an algorithm with actually going to very
z98Lr7105IM,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz 2 Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,160.05,164.3,smartly go through and pick out which decision tree. Because
z98Lr7105IM,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz 2 Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,164.3,165.82000000000002,if we aren't very smart about it and we
z98Lr7105IM,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz 2 Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,165.82,169.13,start eliminating whole decision trees along the way. Then we're
z98Lr7105IM,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz 2 Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,169.13,171.56,"going to have to look it to billions upon, billions"
z98Lr7105IM,Decision Tree Expressiveness Quiz 2 Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,171.56,175.09,"upon, billions upon, billion upon, billion of possible decision choice."
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.08,2.13,"So now, we have an intuition of best, and how we"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,2.13,7.21,"want to split. We've, we've looked over, Michael's proposed, the high-level"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,7.21,9.55,algorithm for how we would build a decision tree. And I
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,9.55,12.600000000000001,"think we have enough information now that we can actually do,"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,12.6,15.77,"a real specific algorithm. So, let's write that down. And the"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,15.77,19.53,particular algorithm that Michael proposed is a kind of generic version
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,19.53,22.270000000000003,of something that's called ID3. So let me write down what
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,22.27,25.11,"that algorithm is, and we can talk about it. Okay, so here's"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,25.11,28.75,the ID3 algorithm. You're simply going to keep looping forever until you've
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,28.75,33.44,"solved the problem. At each step, you're going to pick the best attribute,"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,33.44,35.65,and we're going to define what we mean by best. There are
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,35.65,37.97,"a couple of different ways we might, we might define best in"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,37.97,40.97,"a moment. And then, given the best attribute that splits the"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,40.97,42.66,"data the way that we want, it does all those things that"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,42.66,46.86,"we talked about, assign that as a decision attribute for node."
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,46.86,50.13,"And then for each value that the attribute A can take on,"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,50.13,53.760000000000005,create a descendent of node. Sort the training examples
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,53.76,56.839999999999996,to those leaves based upon exactly what values they
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,56.84,60.31,"take on, and if you've perfectly classified your training"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,60.31,63.75,"set, then you stop. Otherwise, you iterate over each"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,63.75,67.14,"of those leaves, picking the best attribute in turn"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,67.14,69.38,for the training examples that were sorted into that
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,69.38,71.46,"leaf, and you keep doing that. Building up the"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,71.46,75.30999999999999,tree until you're done. So that's the ID3 algorithm.
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,75.31,78.29,And the key bit that we have to expand upon
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,78.29,81.84,"in this case, is exactly what it means to have a"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,81.84,85.32000000000001,"best attribute. All right so, what is exactly, what exactly"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,85.32,87.72999999999999,"is it that we mean by best attribute? So, there are"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,87.73,90.09,"lots of possibilities, that you can come up with. The"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,90.09,92.57000000000001,"one that is most common, and the one I want you"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,92.57,96.08,"to think about the most, is what's called information gain."
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,96.08,101.07,So information gain is simply a mathematical way to capture the
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,101.07,103.02,amount of information that i want to gain by
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,103.02,106.53999999999999,"picking particular attribute, funnily enough. But what it"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,106.54,109.0,really talks about is the reduction in the
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,109.0,112.49,"randomness, over the labels that you have with"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,112.49,115.19,"set of data, based upon the knowing the"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,115.19,118.27,value of particular attribute. So the formula's simply
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,118.27,122.61,this. The information gain over S and A
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,122.61,126.41,where S is the collection of training examples
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,126.41,128.04999999999998,"that you're looking at. And A, as"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,128.05,131.49,"a particular attribute, is simply defined as the"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,131.49,134.97,"entropy, with respect to the labels, of"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,134.97,137.32,"the set of training examples, you have S,"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,137.32,141.605,"minus, sort of, the expected or average"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,141.605,144.95,entropy that you would have over each set
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,144.95,148.01999999999998,of examples that you have with a particular
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,148.02,150.15,"value. Does that make sense to you, Michael?"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,150.15,151.9,">> So what we're doing, we're picking an attribute and"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,151.9,153.25,that attribute could have a bunch of different
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,153.25,156.84,"values, like true or false, or short, medium, tall?"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,156.84,157.01,>> Right.
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,157.01,157.17,>> And.
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,157.17,158.32,>> And that's represented by v.
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,158.32,161.67,">> Okay, each of those is a different v. And then we're"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,161.67,165.47,"saying okay, for over those leaves, we're going to do this entropy thing again."
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,165.47,166.443,>> Mm-hm.
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,166.443,172.42000000000002,">> And we right. So what, and what is entropy?"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,173.47,177.14,">> entropy. So, we'll talk about entropy later on in the class"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,177.14,180.82,in some detail and define it exactly and mathematically. And
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,180.82,183.07999999999998,"some of you probably already know what, what entropy is,"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,183.08,185.07000000000002,"but for those of you who don't, it's exactly a"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,185.07,188.406,"measure of randomness. So if I have a coin, let's"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,188.406,191.03,"say a two-headed coin. It can be heads or tails,"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,191.03,194.07,and I don't know anything about the coin except that
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,194.07,197.79,"it's probably fair. If I were to flip the coin,"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,197.79,201.17,what's the probability that it would end up heads versus tails?
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,201.17,201.83999999999997,>> A half.
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,201.84,202.6,>> It's
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,202.6,204.9,"a half, exactly, if it's a fair coin it's a half."
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,204.9,208.53,"Which means that I have no basis, going into flipping the coin,"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,208.53,212.41,to guess either way whether it's heads or it's tails. And so
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,212.41,214.73,that has a lot of entropy. In fact it has exactly what's
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,214.73,218.22,"called one bit of entropy. On the other hand, let's imagine"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,218.22,221.93,"that I have a coin that has heads on both sides. Then,"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,221.93,224.89000000000001,"before I even flip the coin, I already know what the outcome's"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,224.89,227.61999999999998,going to be. It's going to come up heads. So what's the
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,227.62,229.61,probability of it coming up with heads? It's.
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,229.61,230.73000000000002,>> One.
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,230.73,233.16,>> One. So that actually has no
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,233.16,236.998,"information, no randomness, no entropy whatsoever. And has"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,236.998,241.70999999999998,"zero bits of entropy. So, when I look at this set of examples that I"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,241.71,246.87,"have, and the set of labels I have, I can count the number that are coming up,"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,246.87,253.05,"let's say, red x's. Versus the ones that are coming up green o's."
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,253.05,256.209,"And if those are evenly split, then the entropy of them"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,256.209,258.839,"is maximal, because if I were to close my eyes and"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,258.839,261.769,"reach for an instance, I have no way of knowing beforehand"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,261.769,264.66,whether I'm more likely to get an x or I'm more likely
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,264.66,268.62,"to get an o. On the other hand, if I have"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,268.62,271.97,"all the x's in together, then I already know before I even"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,271.97,274.64000000000004,reach in that I'm going to end up with an x. So
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,274.64,278.15999999999997,as I have more of one label than the other the amount
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,278.16,280.81,"of entropy goes down. That is, I have"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,280.81,283.0,"more information going in. Does that make sense, Michael?"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,283.0,285.392,">> I think so. So, is there, can, maybe we"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,285.392,288.968,"can say what the formula is for this, or, or?"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,288.968,291.56,>> Sure. What is the formula for it? You should remember.
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,292.57,296.412,">> It's, if we have, well, I'm not sure what the notation ought to be with"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,296.412,301.65,"these S's but it has something to do with Log P log, no wait, it's P(log)P."
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,301.65,303.15999999999997,>> Mm-hm. So the
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,303.16,307.05400000000003,"actual formula for entropy, using the same notation that we're"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,307.054,310.09,"using for information gain is simply the sum, over all"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,310.09,313.39,"the possible values that you might see, of the probability"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,313.39,316.62399999999997,"of you seeing that value, times the log of the probability"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,316.624,319.8,"of you seeing that value, times minus one. And I"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,319.8,321.59000000000003,don't want to get into the details here. We're going to go
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,321.59,324.08,into a lot more details about this later when we
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,324.08,328.33,"get further on in the class with randomize optimization, where entropy's"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,328.33,330.44,"going to matter a lot. But for now, I just, you"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,330.44,333.23,"have, I want you to have the intuition that this"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,333.23,336.25,is a measure of information. This is the measure of

IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,347.77,350.5,your eyes and you picked one of the training examples. Okay?
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,350.5,353.12,">> Alright. So, well, so, okay, so then in the practice,"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,354.3,356.78000000000003,"trees that you had given us before, it was the"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,356.78,360.73999999999995,"case that we worked, we wanted to prefer splits that I"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,360.74,362.81,"guess, made things less random, right? So if things were"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,362.81,366.82,"all mixed together, the reds and the greens, after the split"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,366.82,368.3,if it was all reds on one side and all
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,368.3,370.61,greens on the other. Then each of those two sides would
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,370.61,373.66,"have very, what? They would have very low entropy, even though"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,373.66,377.05,when we started out before the split we had high entropy.
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,377.05,379.187,">> Right, that's exactly right. So if you, if you remember the,"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,379.187,382.32,"the, three examples before. One of them, it was the case"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,382.32,385.45,that all of the samples went down the left side of
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,385.45,387.84999999999997,"the tree. So the amount of entropy that we had, didn't"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,387.85,391.46000000000004,change at all. So there was no gain in using that attribute.
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,391.46,394.59,"In another case, we split the data in half. But in"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,394.59,397.51,"each case, we had half of the x's and half of the"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,397.51,400.82,"o's together, on both sides of the split. Which means that"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,400.82,404.43,the total amount of entropy actually didn't change at all. Even though
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,404.43,409.29,"we split the data. And in the final case, the best one, we still split"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,409.29,412.33000000000004,"the data in half, but since all of the x's ended up on one side"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,412.33,415.72999999999996,"and all of the o's ended up on the other side, we had to entropy"
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,415.73,417.94,or no randomness left whatsoever. And that
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,417.94,419.71,gave us the maximum amount of information gain.
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,419.71,421.01,>> So is that how we're choosing the
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,421.01,423.05,best attribute? The one with the maximum gain?
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,423.05,426.88,>> Exactly. So the goal is to maximize over the entropy gain.
IX0iGf2wYM0,ID3 - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,429.16,430.36,And that's the best attribute.
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.35,2.04,">> So, we've got a whole bunch of trees we have"
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,2.04,4.1,"to look at, Michael. And were going to have to come up with"
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,4.1,7.59,some clever way to look through them. And this get's us
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,7.59,10.11,"back, something that we've talked about before, which is the notion of"
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,10.11,16.369999999999997,"bias. And in particular, the notion of inductive bias. Now, just"
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,16.37,18.875,"as a quick refresher, I'm want to remind you that there is"
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,18.875,21.56,two kind of biases we worrying about when we think about algorithms
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,21.56,25.659999999999997,that are searching through space. One is what's called a restriction bias.
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,27.04,28.419999999999998,The other is called preference bias.
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,31.6,34.43,So a restriction bias is nothing more than
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,34.43,37.61,the hypothesis set that you actually care about. So
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,37.61,39.19,"in this case, with the decision trees, the"
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,39.19,43.146,hypothesis set is all possible decision trees. Okay? That
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,43.146,46.701,"means we're not considering, y equals 2x plus"
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,46.701,50.715,3. We're not considering quadratic equations. We're not considering
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,50.715,54.050000000000004,non-boolean functions of a certain type. We're only considering
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,54.05,56.419999999999995,"decision trees, and all that they can represent. And"
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,56.42,59.13,nothing else. Okay? So that's already a restriction bias
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,59.13,62.0,"and it's important. Because, instead of looking at the infinite"
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,62.0,65.86,"number uncountably infinite number of functions that are out there,"
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,65.86,68.12,that we might consider. We're only going to consider those
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,68.12,70.92,that can be represented by a decision tree over
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,70.92,73.44,"in, you know, all the cases we've given so far"
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,73.44,77.08,discreet variable. But a preference bias is something that's just
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,77.08,81.58,as important. And it tells us what source of hypotheses
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,81.58,87.59,"from this hypothesis set we prefer,"
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,87.59,92.924,"and that is really at the heart of inductive bias. So Michael,"
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,92.924,98.04400000000001,"given that, what would you say is the inductive"
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,98.044,102.96,"bias of the ID3 algorithm? That is, given a whole"
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,102.96,108.58999999999999,"bunch of decision trees, which decision trees would ID3 prefer,"
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,108.59,109.08,over others?
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,109.08,114.5,">> So, it definitely tries, since it's, since it's making"
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,114.5,119.78,it's decisions top down. It's going to be more likely to produce a tree that has
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,119.78,123.53,basically good splits near the top than a tree that has bad splits
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,123.53,126.82000000000001,at the top. Even if the two trees can represent the same function.
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,126.82,128.0,>> Good point.
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,130.199,132.42000000000002,So good splits near the top.
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,135.58,136.85000000000002,Alright. And you said something very important
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,136.85,139.42,there Michael. Given two decision trees that
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,139.42,143.61999999999998,"are both correct. They both represent the,"
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,143.62,145.5,the function that we might care about.
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,145.5,150.33,"It would prefer the one that had the better split near the top. Okay,"
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,150.33,154.74,"so any other preferences? Any other inductive bias on the, on the ID3 algorithm."
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,154.74,158.09,>> It prefers ones that model the data
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,158.09,160.68,better to ones that model the data worse.
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,160.68,164.12,>> Right. So this is one that people often forget: it prefers
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,164.12,169.42000000000002,"correct ones to incorrect ones. So, given a tree that has very"
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,169.42,172.70999999999998,good splits at the top but produces the wrong answer. It will
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,172.71,175.33,not take that one over one that doesn't have as good splits at
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,175.33,177.82000000000002,"the top, but does give you the correct answer. So that's really,"
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,177.82,180.1,those are really the two main things that are the inductive bias
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,180.1,183.63,"for ID3. Although, when you put those two together, in particular when"
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,183.63,185.73,"you look at the first one, there's sort of a third one that"
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,185.73,189.45999999999998,"comes out as well, which is ID3 algorithm tends to"
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,189.46,194.28,"prefer shorter trees to longer trees. Now, that preference for shorter"
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,194.28,198.46,trees actually comes naturally from the fact that you're doing
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,198.46,201.39000000000001,good splits at the top. Because you're going to take trees
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,201.39,204.22,"that actually separate the data well by labels, you're going to"
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,204.22,206.82,tend to come to the answer faster than you would if
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,206.82,208.38,"you didn't do that. So, if you go back to"
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,208.38,211.06,"the example where we went before, where one of the attributes"
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,211.06,214.66,"doesn't split the data at all, that is not something that ID3 would"
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,214.66,219.1,"go for, and it would in fact create a longer and unnecessarily longer tree."
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,219.1,222.44,So it tends to prefer shorter trees over longer trees. So long as
iBvBbbStx5Y,ID3 Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,222.44,225.35,they're correct and they give you good splits near the top of the tree.
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.42,2.77,"Alright. So, we've actually done pretty well. So through all of"
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,2.77,4.98,"this, we finally figured out what decision trees actually are. We know"
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,4.98,8.029,what they represent. We know how expressive they are. We have
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,8.029,13.559999999999999,an algorithm that let's us build the decision trees in an effective
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,13.56,17.27,way. We've done just about everything there is to do with
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,17.27,20.71,"decision trees, but there is still a couple of open questions that"
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,20.71,23.01,"I want to think about. So, here's a couple of them and"
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,23.01,25.28,"I want you to, to think about and then we'll discuss them."
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,26.36,30.06,"So, so far all of our examples that we've used. All"
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,30.06,33.79,the the things we've been thinking about for good pedagogical reasons. We
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,33.79,39.05,had not only discreet outputs but we also had discreet inputs. So
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,39.05,43.019999999999996,"one question we might ask ourselves, is what happens if we have,"
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,45.4,49.07,"continuous attributes? So Michael, let me ask"
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,49.07,51.62,you this. Let's say we had some continuous
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,51.62,53.36,attributes. We weren't just asking whether someone's an
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,53.36,54.9,animal or whether they're human or whether it's
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,54.9,57.36,raining outside or we really cared about age
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,58.38,60.870000000000005,or weight or distance or anything else that
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,60.87,62.93,might have a continuous attribute. How are we
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,62.93,64.78,going to make that work in a decision tree?
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,64.78,67.11,">> Well, I guess the literal way to do it would"
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,67.11,70.42999999999999,be for something like age to have a branching factor that's equal
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,70.43,71.87,to the number of possible ages.
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,71.87,77.19,">> Okay, so that's one, one possibility. So we stick in age and then"
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,77.19,82.507,"we have one. 1.0, we have one for 1.1, we"
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,82.507,87.742,"have one for 1.11, we have one for 1.111"
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,87.742,92.62,">> Ahh, I see. Alright. Well, at the very least, okay. Heheheh. What"
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,92.62,95.97,"if, what if we only included ages that were in the training set?"
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,95.97,98.42999999999999,"Presumably there's at least a finite number of those. Oh,"
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,98.43,100.51,"we could do that. We could just do that, except"
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,100.51,102.5,what are we going to do then when we come up
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,102.5,106.66,with something in the future that wasn't in the training session.
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,106.66,109.58,">> Oh, right. Can we look at the testing set?"
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,109.58,112.7,">> No were not allowed to look at the testing set. That is cheating,"
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,112.7,115.64,and not the kind of good cheating that we do when we pic good representation.
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,115.64,121.69,">> Okay, fair enough. Well we could, we could Ranges. What about ranges?"
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,121.69,124.72,Isn't that the way we cover more than just individual values?
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,124.72,125.62,>> Give me an example.
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,125.62,129.09,">> Say ages you know, in the 20s."
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,129.09,132.48,">> Okay, so, huh. How would we represent that"
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,132.48,138.97,with a decision tree? Let's say in the 20s. Age.
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,138.97,139.57,>> How we do that.
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,139.57,142.78,">> You could do like age, element sign, bracket."
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,142.78,143.68,>> 20.
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,143.68,147.4,">> 20 comma 21, or, or 29 or 30 right"
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,147.4,148.73000000000002,per end.
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,148.73,153.85999999999999,>> Yeah it's too much. Why don't I just say age
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,155.46,162.20000000000002,"Is between less is, let's see, greater than or equal to, 20 and, less than 30."
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,162.2,167.2,"And just draw a big oval for that. Alright? So that's a range, so"
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,167.2,171.89999999999998,"that's all numbers between, 20 and 30 inclusive of 20 but not 30 Right."
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,171.9,172.46,>> Yeah.
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,173.81,176.95,>> And what's good about that is that's a question. You are either in your
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,176.95,185.118,"20s or you are not. So, the output of that is actually true or false."
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,185.118,188.17,">> So, I guess the good news there is that now"
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,188.17,190.95999999999998,we know how to evaluate attributes like that because we have
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,190.96,193.84,a formula from ID3 that tells you what to do.
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,193.84,197.22,But seems like there's an awful lot of different ones to check.
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,197.22,198.93,">> Right, and in fact if it's"

LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,202.01,205.17,them checked. But we can do now the sort of cheating you wanted
LgLMX5nYfN4,Decision Trees Continuous Attributes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,205.17,207.75,"to do before. We can just look at the training set, and"

8VG2dCvsAXE,Decision Trees Other Considerations Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,34.81,37.89,"A might appear more than once in the tree. So, for example,"
8VG2dCvsAXE,Decision Trees Other Considerations Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,40.8,43.47,you might have been the case where A shows up more

qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,20.57,23.84,"That's a pretty good answer, Michael. But what if we have"
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,23.84,27.0,noise in our data? What if it's the case that we
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,27.0,31.29,"have two examples of the same object, the same instance, but"
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,31.29,33.62,they have two different labels? Then this will never be the case.

qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,50.15,52.69,That's probably a slightly better answer. Although that
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,52.69,55.61,doesn't help us in the case where we have continuous attributes and we might ask
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,55.61,57.48,an infinite number of questions. So we probably
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,57.48,60.879999999999995,need a slightly better criteria. Don't you think?
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,60.88,61.95,>> Hm.
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,61.95,65.86,">> So, what got us down this path, was thinking about what happens"

qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,71.11,75.21,"Well, I guess the training data might have gotten corrupted"
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,75.21,78.41999999999999,a little bit or maybe somebody copied something down wrong.

qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,81.47,85.53999999999999,does it really make sense to trust the

qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,87.78,93.48,the point where we perfectly classify the training data?

qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,209.83,212.9,validation set and you pick whichever one has the lowest error
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,212.9,215.44,"in the validation sect, that's one way to avoid it."
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,215.44,217.89,"And then you have, don't have to worry about this question"
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,217.89,221.0,"about stopping, you just grow the tree on the training"
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,221.0,224.98,set minus the validation set until it does well on that.
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,224.98,226.77599999999998,"And you check it against the crossvalid, you check it against"
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,226.776,230.092,"the validation set, and you pick the best one. That's one way"
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,230.092,233.29000000000002,"of doing it, and that would work perfectly fine. There is"
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,233.29,237.17,"another way you can do it that's more efficient. Which is, you"
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,237.17,240.98,"do the same idea validation, except that you hold out a"
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,240.98,245.10999999999999,"set and as you, everytime you decide whether to expand the tree"
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,245.11,247.57000000000002,"or not, you check to see how this would do so"
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,247.57,250.62,"far in the validation set. And if the error is low enough,"
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,250.62,254.02,then you stop expanding the tree. That's one way of doing it.
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,254.02,256.399,">> So is there, is there a problem in terms of, I mean if"
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,256.399,261.36,"we're expanding the tree depth for search wise, we could be at, you know,"
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,261.36,263.71000000000004,we could be looking at one tiny little split on one side of the
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,263.71,266.53,"tree before we even look at any, anything on the other side of the tree."
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,266.53,269.22999999999996,>> That's a fine point. So how would you fix that?
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,269.23,270.87,>> Maybe expand breadth first?
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,270.87,275.61,">> Yeah, that would probably do it. Anything else you could think of? Well,"
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,275.61,278.059,"so, you could do pruning, right? You could go ahead and"
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,278.059,280.399,do the tree as if you didn't have to worry about
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,280.399,283.699,"over-fitting, and once you have the full tree built, you could"
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,283.699,286.325,"then do a kind of, you could do pruning. You could"
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,286.325,288.84499999999997,"go to the leaves of the tree and say, well, what"
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,288.845,291.814,if I collapse these leaves back up into the tree? How
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,291.814,296.85,does that create error on my validation set? And if the
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,296.85,300.66,"error is too big, then you don't do it. And if it's"
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,300.66,302.15000000000003,"very small, then you go ahead and do"
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,302.15,304.46,it. And that should help you with overfitting.
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,304.46,306.79999999999995,"So, that whole class of ways of doing"
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,306.8,309.88,"it, is called pruning. And there's a whole bunch"
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,309.88,312.27,"of different ways you might prune. But pruning,"
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,312.27,314.14,"itself, is one way of dealing with overfitting,"
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,314.14,316.05,and giving you a smaller tree. And it's
qDMh645ph0Q,Decision Trees Other Considerations - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,316.05,318.69,a very simple addition to the standard ID3 algorithm.
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.43,2.36,So another consideration we might want to think about with
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,2.36,4.55,decision trees but you're not going to go into a lot
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,4.55,6.29,of detail but I think might be worth at least
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,6.29,10.89,"mentioning is the problem of regression. So, so far we've"
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,10.89,15.440000000000001,"only been doing classification ,where the outputs are discreet, but"
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,15.44,17.85,what if we were trying to solve something that looked
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,17.85,21.93,"more like x squared or two x plus 17, or"
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,21.93,25.66,"some other continuous function. In other words, a regression problem."
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,25.66,30.39,"How would we have to adapt decision trees, to do that? Any ideas Michael?"
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,31.75,35.56,">> So these are now continuous outputs, not just continuous inputs."
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,35.56,37.89,">> Right, maybe the outputs are all continuous, maybe"
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,37.89,40.37,"the outputs are discrete, maybe they're a mix of both."
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,40.37,41.379999999999995,>> Well it certainly seems like out
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,41.38,44.84,"rule of using, information gain is going to run"
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,44.84,47.150000000000006,into trouble because it's not really clear how
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,47.15,50.85,"you measure information on these continuous values. So,"
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,50.85,56.88,"I guess you could measure error some other way. Well we're not, it's not, it's"
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,56.88,60.719,"not error right it's tryin to measure how mixed up things are? Oh so ,maybe"
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,60.719,63.14,something like variance? Cause in a continuous
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,63.14,64.47,"space you could talk about you know, if"
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,64.47,66.11,"there's a big spread of, in the values"
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,66.11,68.0,"that, that would be measured by the variance."
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,68.0,70.44,>> Oh good. So what you really have now is
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,70.44,75.15599999999999,a question about splitting. What's the splitting criteria? Maybe [CROSSTALK]
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,75.156,75.9,>> I guess there's also an
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,75.9,78.0,"issue of, of what you do in the leaves."
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,78.0,81.28,">> Right. So, what might you do in the leaves?"
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,81.28,87.27,>> I guess you could do some sort of more standard kind of fitting algorithm.
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,87.27,94.55499999999999,"So, like, report the average or, or do some kind of a linear fit. [SOUND]"
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,94.555,97.27000000000001,">> Is any number of things you can do. By the way ,that's worth pointing out"
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,97.27,101.64,"on the, on the output that if we do pruning like we did before, we have errors,"
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,101.64,104.42,we did actually say when we talked about that how you
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,104.42,107.19,would report an output. Right? If you don't have a clear
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,107.19,111.06,"answer where everything is labeled true or everything is labled false,"
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,111.06,114.11,how do you pick? So something like an average would work there.
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,114.11,115.76,">> I don't know, I mean, it seems like it depends"
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,115.76,117.74000000000001,on what we're trying to measure with the tree. If the tree
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,117.74,120.74,"is, we're trying to get as many right answers as we can,"
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,120.74,123.178,then you probably want to do like a vote in the leaves.
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,123.178,126.6,">> Right, which ,at least, if the only answer is true or false,"
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,126.6,128.72899999999998,"that would look more like an average I guess. Right, so"
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,128.729,130.74,"you pick, you do a vote. So we do a vote,"
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,130.74,132.86,so we do pruning. We do have to deal with this
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,132.86,139.31,"issue of the output. Somehow ,and something like a vote mixing."
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,142.21,148.58,"And here, when you have a regression, then I guess average is a lot like voting."
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,148.58,150.16000000000003,">> Yeah, in a continuous phase."
dE7bgpf0okQ,Decision Trees Other Considerations  Regression - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,150.16,153.82,>> Yeah. So either way we're doing a kind of voting. I like that.

khM2LClDSs4,Decision Trees Wrap up - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,23.63,26.11,">> All right. So we got a representation,"
khM2LClDSs4,Decision Trees Wrap up - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,26.11,28.15,we got a top down learning algorithm ID3.
khM2LClDSs4,Decision Trees Wrap up - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,28.15,31.79,">> We learned about the, the expressiveness and the bias."
khM2LClDSs4,Decision Trees Wrap up - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,31.79,35.37,">> Right. So those are 2 separate things, we learned about"
khM2LClDSs4,Decision Trees Wrap up - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,35.37,41.22,the sort of expressiveness. And we learned about the bias of ID3.
khM2LClDSs4,Decision Trees Wrap up - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,41.22,48.51,">> And we gave one, so is this specific to ID3? We, we looked at one specific"

khM2LClDSs4,Decision Trees Wrap up - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,54.205,60.44,">> Right. So we talked about in general,um, what are good attributes or what"

khM2LClDSs4,Decision Trees Wrap up - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,64.25,66.83,one way of doing it. As one example.
khM2LClDSs4,Decision Trees Wrap up - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,66.83,69.61,"And, by the way, this notion of best attribute is something we'll end"

D8PNnttuGZk,Regression Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,58.59,62.13,be the focus on continuous. So regression seems
D8PNnttuGZk,Regression Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,62.13,65.78,like sort of an odd word. It doesn't really kind of fit for this. So often
D8PNnttuGZk,Regression Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,65.78,70.75,"I think about regression as. So this is, this is me being all sad and sort"

D8PNnttuGZk,Regression Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,122.18,125.10000000000001,"you know, sort of Charles' height? Or"
D8PNnttuGZk,Regression Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,125.1,127.22,average height or may be somewhere between.
D8PNnttuGZk,Regression Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,128.258,130.43,So let's let's actually ask this as a quiz.
XA9vnKoz44A,Regression Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.36,2.34,"Okay, Charles, so what do you, what do you think about this?"
XA9vnKoz44A,Regression Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,2.34,3.63,">> Wait, how old are my children?"
XA9vnKoz44A,Regression Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,3.63,5.949999999999999,>> Let's say what their adult height is going to be.
XA9vnKoz44A,Regression Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,5.95,10.61,>> I would expect them to be a little bit smaller than me.
XA9vnKoz44A,Regression Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,10.61,12.735,>> A little bit smaller than you?
XA9vnKoz44A,Regression Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,12.735,13.379,>> Mm-hmm.
XA9vnKoz44A,Regression Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,13.379,15.251,">> So, so their, the average height, their"
XA9vnKoz44A,Regression Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,15.251,17.487,"average height of your children, you would you say"
XA9vnKoz44A,Regression Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,17.487,19.81,it would be like an average height person?
XA9vnKoz44A,Regression Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,19.81,21.31,Or like your height or sort of in between?
XA9vnKoz44A,Regression Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,21.31,22.169999999999998,>> In between.
XA9vnKoz44A,Regression Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,22.17,25.660000000000004,>> In between. All right. So it
XA9vnKoz44A,Regression Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,25.66,29.72,"turns out that if you actually do this, you measure people's"
XA9vnKoz44A,Regression Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,29.72,32.83,"heights and you measure the heights of their children, that that"
XA9vnKoz44A,Regression Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,32.83,34.86,"is in fact what you tend to see. That very, very"
XA9vnKoz44A,Regression Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,34.86,38.56,"tall people, like you tend to have taller than average children."
XA9vnKoz44A,Regression Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,38.56,42.77,But the height is between. It actually regresses to the mean.
XA9vnKoz44A,Regression Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,42.77,44.760000000000005,And here we really do mean regresses in the sense of
XA9vnKoz44A,Regression Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,44.76,47.42,"going back to this kind of more primitive state that, if"
XA9vnKoz44A,Regression Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,47.42,51.44,"you think about average height people, as being like your ancestors,"
XA9vnKoz44A,Regression Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,51.44,53.346999999999994,"then, you know, you as a, as a very tall"
XA9vnKoz44A,Regression Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,53.347,55.95,person tend to have kids that that tend regress back
XA9vnKoz44A,Regression Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,55.95,60.24,"toward that average value that sort of, more older, more"
XA9vnKoz44A,Regression Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,60.24,63.03,ancient value. So does that that make some sense to you?
XA9vnKoz44A,Regression Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,63.03,65.63,>> That makes some sense. But one comment and
XA9vnKoz44A,Regression Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,65.63,68.97,"one question. Comment, that is awesome because I've always actually"
XA9vnKoz44A,Regression Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,68.97,71.89,"wondered what regresses to the mean actually means. The second,"
XA9vnKoz44A,Regression Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,71.89,74.708,what prevents us from all being the same height then?
XA9vnKoz44A,Regression Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,74.708,76.3,">> Yes, so what,"
XA9vnKoz44A,Regression Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,76.3,79.94,what seems to be happening is that there's a kind of a noisy process and some
XA9vnKoz44A,Regression Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,79.94,82.41,"people turn out to be taller, but then"
XA9vnKoz44A,Regression Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,82.41,85.14,"the, then the next generation there's a little"
XA9vnKoz44A,Regression Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,85.14,86.75,bit of a history effect in people stay
XA9vnKoz44A,Regression Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,86.75,88.54,"taller, but it tends to drift back towards"
XA9vnKoz44A,Regression Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,88.54,92.21000000000001,"the mean. So it's, so it's, it's sort of like a random walk, to some extent."
XA9vnKoz44A,Regression Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,92.21,94.22,">> Oh, that actually kind of makes sense."
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,0.12,0.98,"Alright, so what does this have to"
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,0.98,3.17,do with function approximation or regression. So
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,3.17,6.85,how does this notion of regression of falling back toward the mean have to do
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,6.85,9.29,"with this idea of approximating functions, mapping"
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,9.29,12.12,"inputs to outputs, it seems kind of odd."
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,12.12,13.969999999999999,So it turns out that the relationship
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,13.97,16.89,"is, here's the, here's the connection between them."
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,18.91,21.46,I'm going to draw a graph and on this axis
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,21.46,26.55,will be the parent height. And on this axis
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,26.55,29.46,will be the average child height. So if we
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,29.46,32.47,"plot these against each other, let's let me put"
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,32.47,35.019999999999996,the mean up here. Let's say that this is
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,35.02,38.918000000000006,mean height for the population. And now say that
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,38.918,40.769999999999996,"you know pair, we sort of imagine that parents"
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,40.77,45.21,of average height will have children of average height.
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,45.21,48.58,"But parents that are really tall, like that"
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,48.58,51.75,"hypothetical person from before, will have children that"
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,51.75,54.61,are taller than average but not as tall
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,54.61,59.47,as themselves. And similarly people that are very
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,59.47,62.64,let's say of smaller stature will have children
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,62.64,65.68,"that are also you know short. And, but"
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,65.68,67.5,not quite as short again closer to the
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,67.5,70.46,"mean. And it turns out that you have this,"
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,70.46,76.14399999999999,"this very nice linear relationship between these quantities, and, there's an"
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,76.144,80.21000000000001,important aspect to this. Which is that the slope of this
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,80.21,83.52,"line is less than one, it's two thirds. Right. If the"
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,83.52,85.64999999999999,"slope of this line was one, what would that mean Charles?"
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,85.65,89.15,>> That would mean that everybody's children had
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,89.15,91.36,"the, would, the same height of their parents."
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,91.36,93.77,">> Right, right, and so that's exactly right, and so"
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,93.77,95.57,"but if this slope is less than one, like it is,"
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,95.57,99.91999999999999,"it turns out to be in, in real populations. Then what's happening is the"
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,99.92,101.49,children are little shorter than the parents.
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,101.49,103.786,Children of taller parents are shorter than they
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,103.786,107.235,are. And the children of short parents are taller than they are. And that's the
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,107.235,111.13,fact that this is less than one is what makes it regression to the mean.
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,115.25,117.69200000000001,"Now this, this was worked out in I believe in"
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,117.692,120.464,the late 1800s and it was just such a beautiful
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,120.464,124.32,way of connecting all these different quantities together. To kind of
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,124.32,127.57,think of them as being related in this functional way.
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,127.57,129.50799999999998,"That people said, oh this is really great. I'm going to"
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,129.508,132.43,use this idea of regression. And what they started to
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,132.43,135.33,mean actually was this not this idea of regression to
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,135.33,140.41000000000003,"the mean. But this idea of finding a, a mathematical"
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,140.41,145.56,relationship based on a bunch of measurements of points. So this term ended up
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,145.56,150.6,getting misused. But that's the term that we have now. So regression now refers
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,150.6,156.47,"to not this idea of collapsing back towards, towards the mean, but, the idea of"
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,156.47,161.0,using functional form to approximate a bunch of data points. Isn't that weird.
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,161.0,162.36,>> That's pretty cool.
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,162.36,165.85000000000002,>> There's another example of this sort of idea where where a reasonable
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,165.85,169.25,"word, like, like regression which we're referring to some physical thing"
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,169.25,172.29,"in the, in the world due to experiments like psych experiments at"
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,172.29,175.26999999999998,this point became this mathematical concept where the name doesn't really
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,175.27,178.49,"fit anymore, like there isn't really anything regressing in what we're doing."
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,178.49,179.33100000000002,>> Mm-hm.
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,179.331,180.91,">> There's another, really important example"
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,180.91,181.75,that we're going to get to the later
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,181.75,183.54,"in the course. Do you, do you know what I'm thinking of Charles?"
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,183.54,184.29999999999998,>> No.
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,184.3,186.49,>> So reinforcement learning is my field
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,186.49,188.97,of study. And often your field of study.
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,188.97,189.64,>> Often.
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,189.64,190.89,>> Often.
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,190.89,195.38,And it turns out that reinforcement learning doesn't mean what
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,195.38,197.54,the words mean anymore. That this was a concept that
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,197.54,200.13,the psychologist used to explain what they were observing. And
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,200.13,204.57999999999998,"then some mathematicians, well let's call them computer scientists, took"
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,204.58,206.97,"the word themselves, started to use it and used it"
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,206.97,210.18,"wrong, but now it stuck. [LAUGH] And regression is another"
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,210.18,211.87,"example like that. They, the word is sort of being"
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,211.87,213.75,"used wrong, but it stuck and that's what we're going to use."
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,213.75,215.95,>> This explains why every time I have a conversation
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,215.95,220.17,"with a psychologist about reinforcement learning, we talk past each other."
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,220.17,223.85,">> Yes, they get very confused. I tried it to tell them upfront that's not"
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,223.85,225.29,"really what I mean, but I'm going to use"
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,225.29,227.31,"the words anyway, but it still confuses them."
zQLP2UQDND0,Regression and Function Approximation,227.31,227.81,>> Hmm.
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,0.68,3.79,"Alright, so, one of the things that's very helpful about regression is"
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,3.79,6.45,"that in many ways it's very simple to visualize, it's very simple"
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,6.45,9.57,to think about what some of the issues are and all the
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,9.57,13.46,various topics in machine learning that are really important to understand and
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,13.46,16.72,sometimes are difficult concepts really do come up in a fairly easy
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,16.72,19.07,to understand way. So what I'd like to do now is to
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,19.07,22.89,step through an example Of doing some regression and to point out
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,22.89,25.79,what some of the pitfalls are and how they're generally handled in
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,25.79,29.31,"the machine learning context. So, this graph that I put"
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,29.31,33.96,"up here, is, we just made these numbers up, but it's"
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,33.96,37.26,"supposed to tell us a, a little bit about housing"
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,37.26,40.0,prices. So let's imagine that we're off to buy a house
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,40.0,42.17,and What we notice is that there's lots of different
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,42.17,45.81,"houses on the market, and there are lots of different, sizes,"
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,45.81,48.749,"right. So ,the square footage of the house can vary. And"
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,48.749,51.134,"in this case the houses that I visited can be between,"
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,51.134,54.32,"about 1,000 to 10,000 square feet. And of course, as"
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,54.32,57.91,"you get bigger houses, you tend to get more, the, the"
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,57.91,60.419999999999995,"prices tend to go up, too. Alright, so the price"
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,60.42,64.4,"that the house cost is, tends to rise with the size"
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,64.4,66.42,"of the house. So, what I've done here is I've"
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,66.42,69.49,plotted as a little x say a set of nine houses
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,69.49,73.03,that I've observed. Start off over here with a house
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,73.03,76.79,"that's a 1,000 square feet and cost a $1,000? I don't"
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,76.79,79.74000000000001,know what year this happened in. And we end
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,79.74,81.78999999999999,"up with a house that is 10,000 square feet"
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,81.79,85.73,"and cost about $6,000. Again, I don't. This is"
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,85.73,87.61,"not true in Providence Rhode Island, I'll tell you that."
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,87.61,88.52,>> Are you sure?
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,88.52,92.0,">> Yeah, I'm pretty sure."
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,92.0,93.82,">> Yeah, it's really not true in Atlanta Georgia."
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,94.98,99.07000000000001,">> So Alright... So, so, so imagine that this is the relationship we"
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,99.07,102.5,"observe. But now we want to answer a question like, Well, what happens"
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,102.5,106.05,"If we find a house on the market and it's about $5,000,"
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,106.05,108.11,what do you think a fair price for that would be? So what
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,108.11,109.85,"do you, what do you think, Charles? Looking at this, what do"
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,109.85,113.75,"you think a fair price for a 5,000 square foot house would be?"
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,113.75,115.234,">> Apparently about $5,000."
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,115.234,118.22,">> About, $5,000. Right. So, how did you do that?"
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,118.22,122.09,">> I looked at the graph, I went over to 5,000 square"
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,122.09,127.54,"feet at the x-axis and I went up. Until I found ,where one"
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,127.54,131.76000000000002,"of the x's was on the y axis and I said, oh, that's about 5,000 square feet."
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,131.76,133.76,">> Well, but there was no corresponding point for that,"
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,133.76,136.79999999999998,"so you had to interpolate or something ,uh, based on the"
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,136.8,138.70000000000002,points that were there you had to kind of imagine what
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,138.7,141.57999999999998,"might, might be happening at the 5,000 square foot mark, right?"
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,141.58,144.67000000000002,">> That's true, although this one was a little easy because"
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,144.67,148.82,"at 4,000 and 6,000 square feet, they were almost exactly the same."
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,148.82,153.01999999999998,">> Mm, and so that, to you, made it feel like there was probably ,um,"
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,153.02,155.51000000000002,that's probably the level where things in this range would be.
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,155.51,155.81,>> Yeah.
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,155.81,158.26,">> Okay. Alright, that seems kind of"
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,158.26,161.34,"reasonable. So sure, though what we're going to"
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,161.34,164.57,"do in this case is actually try to find a, a function that fits this."
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,164.57,165.26,>> Mm-hm.
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,165.26,167.63,">> Alright ,so what we can do is actually say, well what"
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,167.63,171.17,if there is a linear relationship. What would be the best linear
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,171.17,175.33499999999998,function that captures the relationship between the size and the cost. So
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,175.335,178.61,",what I have here is, it turns out of all the possible"
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,178.61,182.71,"linear functions, this is the one that minimizes the"
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,182.71,187.24,"squared error, the squared deviation, between these x points"
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,187.24,190.28,and the corresponding position on green line. So it
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,190.28,192.3,finds a way of balancing all those different errors against
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,192.3,195.3,each other and that's the best line we've got.
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,195.3,197.34,"Now in this particular case, it's interesting right, because if"
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,197.34,200.36,"you put your idea of 5,000 square feet. Look"

Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,204.1,204.59,Do you see that?
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,204.59,205.99,>> I do. That is doesn't seem right to me.
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,205.99,210.60000000000002,">> It doesn't, yeah, it doesn't really look like a very good fit. But it"
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,210.6,212.04999999999998,does at least capture the fact that there
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,212.05,215.99,"is increasing cost with, with increase in size."
Kto_QBCR9q0,Linear Regression,215.99,216.86,>> That's true.
fSu9kSnId0s,Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.52,2.95,"Alright. So it's worth asking, how do we find"
fSu9kSnId0s,Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,2.95,6.98,this best line? So again there's an infinite number
fSu9kSnId0s,Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,6.98,8.71,of lines. How do we find one that fits
fSu9kSnId0s,Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,8.71,11.46,these points the best. And again we're defining best fit.
fSu9kSnId0s,Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,13.6,16.73,"As the one that has the least squared error, where the error is"
fSu9kSnId0s,Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,16.73,20.97,going to be some of the distances between these x points and the green line

fSu9kSnId0s,Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,28.68,32.49,"is to say, we kind of pick the. The slope and the intercept of"

fSu9kSnId0s,Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,45.58,48.21,with it? Or is this the sort of thing where we probably would just
fSu9kSnId0s,Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,48.21,49.730000000000004,go and ask a physicist because it
fSu9kSnId0s,Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,49.73,52.949999999999996,"involves, like, continuous quantities, and we're discrete people?"
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.75,2.91,And that's the correct answer. All right. So let's
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,2.91,6.08,actually go through that exercise and derive how we
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,6.08,7.53,do that. because it's not so bad in two
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,7.53,9.9,dimensions and it generalizes to higher dimensions as well.
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,9.9,10.73,>> Okay.
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,10.73,13.0,">> So it turns out that we can use calculus to do this, I"
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,13.0,17.79,am not going to step through the two-variable example for reasons that I am
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,17.79,22.29,embarrassed to say. But I am going to show you a different example. So
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,22.29,26.419999999999998,imagine that what we're trying to do is that we've got a bunch of data
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,26.42,30.770000000000003,"points, and we're trying to find the best constant function, right? So the best"
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,30.77,36.42,"function that has the form, the value of the function for"
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,36.42,41.550000000000004,"any given X is always the same constant, C. So if our data looks like this, we"
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,41.55,43.959999999999994,"got a bunch of X's and a bunch of Y's,"
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,43.96,45.53,"then what we're going to do, we're going to say for"
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,45.53,49.53,"any given value of C, any given constant, we can have"
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,49.53,51.480000000000004,an error. What's the error going to be? The error is
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,51.48,54.41,going to be the sum over all of the data points. Speaker 1: The square
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,54.41,58.459999999999994,difference between that constant we chose and what
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,58.46,60.660000000000004,the actual yi value is. So that's why.
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,60.66,61.29,>> Michael.
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,61.29,63.3,">> These differences here. Yes, Charles."
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,64.379,65.665,>> Can I ask you a question?
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,65.665,67.2,>> Sure.
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,67.2,68.739,>> Why are we doing sum of squares?
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,71.01,75.13000000000001,>> There is many different error functions and sometimes called
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,75.13,77.42999999999999,"a, a relative concept called the loss function. There is"
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,77.43,79.25,"lots of difference once that could work, you can do"
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,79.25,82.41,"the absolute error, you can do the squared error, you can"
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,82.41,86.06,do various kinds of squashed errors where you know. The
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,86.06,88.88,"errors count different depending on how, how much deviation there is."
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,90.32,92.78999999999999,It turns out that this one is particularly well behaved
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,92.79,96.55000000000001,because of this reason that I'm explaining now that that because
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,96.55,100.24,this error function is smooth as a function of the constant
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,100.24,104.44999999999999,"C, we can use calculus to actually find the minimum error"
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,104.45,107.36,value. But there's lots of other things that could work and
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,107.36,111.53999999999999,they actually do find utility in various different machine learning settings.
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,111.54,112.4,>> Okay.
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,112.4,113.97,">> So just now using the chain rule, if"
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,113.97,116.56,you want to find how do this error function
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,116.56,119.32000000000001,output change as a function of input c. We
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,119.32,122.3,"can take the derivative of this sum you know,"
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,122.3,126.95,"bring the two over. Times this, times the derivative of the inside, which"
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,126.95,129.46,"is negative one in this case. And now this gives us a nice, smooth"
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,129.46,133.48000000000002,function saying what the error is as a function of c. And if we
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,133.48,135.88,"want to find the minimum, what do we want to do to this quantity?"
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,135.88,138.859,">> Set it equal to zero, because that's what I remember from Calculus."
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,140.51,143.22,">> That's right. So in particular if the error you know, the error"
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,143.22,147.42,function is a nice smooth thing the derivative is negative and then zero and
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,147.42,149.45,then positive. When it hits zero that's when the thing
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,149.45,152.17,has bottomed-out. Alright. So now we just need to solve
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,152.17,155.69,"this, this equation for c. So we have one equation"
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,155.69,160.0,"and one unknown. Alright, so that gets us this. But,"
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,160.0,163.15,"this quantity, it's just the constant added to itself n"
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,163.15,166.59,times. So it's n times c. We move that to
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,166.59,169.70000000000002,the other side. We get n times c. N is
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,169.7,172.45999999999998,the number of data points as you recall. Is the
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,172.46,177.66,sum of the yi's. We divide
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,177.66,182.57999999999998,two by n and what do we see? So what is it Charles?
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,182.58,185.08,>> The best constant is the average of all your y's.
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,185.08,189.75,">> Great, it's the mean. The mean comes back. Right, so"
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,189.75,192.17,"in the case of finding the best constant here, we just have"
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,192.17,195.07,"to average the y, the y's together and that catches thing that"
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,195.07,197.56,minimizes the squared air. So squared air is this really nice thing
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,197.56,200.82,because it tends to bring things like mean back into the picture. It's really
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,200.82,203.31,"very convenient. And, it generalizes to higher,"
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,203.31,206.95,"higher order of function tier, not higher"
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,206.95,209.79,"functions, but more variables like, like lines."
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,209.79,211.73999999999998,"Sorry. Lines that have some, some non"
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,211.74,215.77,constant slope. By doing the same kind
dewLtKqna04,Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,215.77,217.84,of process and things actually work really nicely.
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,0.7,2.9299999999999997,"Alright, so now let's, let's get back to our data set that"
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,2.93,6.25,"we were looking at before. So again, the ideas that we're, we're going to"
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,6.25,9.83,try to find a way of predicting the value for various points along
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,9.83,12.77,the way on this curve. And one thing we could do is find
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,12.77,15.959999999999999,the best line. But we also talked now about finding the best constant.
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,15.96,19.12,Turns out these all belong to a family of functions that we could
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,19.12,23.490000000000002,fit. Which are functions of this form. Alright. We've got x is our
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,23.49,26.2,input and what we're going to do is we're going to take some constant and
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,26.2,31.75,add that to some scaled version of x times some scaled version of x squared plus
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,31.75,35.19,"some scaled version of x cubed, all the way up to some order k. And we've"
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,35.19,37.71,"talked about k equals zero, the constant function."
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,37.71,39.38,"And k equals one, the line. But there's"
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,39.38,42.57,"also k equals two, parabola. Would it probably"
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,42.57,44.410000000000004,be a good choice at this particular case?
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,44.41,45.769999999999996,>> Yes.
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,45.77,49.900000000000006,">> It does seem like it's got, sort of, curvy downy nature, right?"
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,49.9,51.108,>> Mm hm.
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,51.108,51.33,>> It's
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,51.33,53.44,going up and it's kind of flattening out and maybe we could
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,53.44,57.54,"imagine that it starts coming down again? At least, over the course of"
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,57.54,59.79,"these points, it doesn't come down again but at least it sort of"
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,59.79,62.839999999999996,flattened out. So let's take a look at that. Let's take a look
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,62.84,67.67,"at the. The best parabola to fit this. Alright, so, so here"
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,67.67,70.87,"we go. We've got the, the best line now, the best constant function"
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,70.87,73.85000000000001,which is just the average. We have the best line with some slope
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,73.85,76.47999999999999,to it. That's the green one. We have now the best parabola and
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,76.48,78.03,"look at it, it does, it does a nice job,"
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,78.03,80.93,"right? Kind a gets, gets tucked in with all those other"
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,80.93,83.72000000000001,"points. so, so what do you think? Is this the"
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,83.72,87.34,"best way of, of capturing this. This particular set of points?"
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,87.34,92.14,">> Well, if the only thing we care about is minimizing the sum of squared"
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,92.14,97.49,"error, my guess is that the parabola has less squared error."
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,98.64,102.11,">> Yeah. It ha, there's more degrees of freedom so at the worst"
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,102.11,105.38,we could have just fit the parabola as a line. Right.
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,105.38,109.33,"We can always just set any of these coefficients to, to zero."
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,109.33,111.86,So if the best fit to this really was a line. The
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,111.86,114.41,"best fit to this data point was a line, then the parabola"
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,114.41,117.36999999999999,"that we see here wouldn't have any curve to it. So,"
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,117.37,120.693,"yeah. Our arrows going down. Hm, As we have gone from order"
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,120.693,123.96,zero to order one to order two. So can you think of
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,123.96,126.22999999999999,any other way getting there in order to getting down even more.
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,126.23,127.53,>> How about order
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,127.53,128.24,14 million.
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,129.83,133.15,">> Interesting, while in this particular case,"
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,133.15,134.88,"given the amount of data that we have,"
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,134.88,136.51999999999998,we can't go past the number of
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,136.52,140.53,"data points, yeh after that. They're really unconstrained."
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,140.53,142.18,>> Okay. Then how about order nine?
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,142.18,145.14000000000001,>> Order nine is a good idea. But just to
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,145.14,146.76999999999998,"give you an idea here, we're going to step up a little"
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,146.77,148.57000000000002,"more. This is order four and look at, look at how"
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,148.57,153.14,"lovely it can actually capture the flow here. That's, very faded."
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,153.14,157.29,"Order six and in fact the best we can do here is of the, of the,"
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,157.29,158.95999999999998,"sorry. The most, the highest order that, that"
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,158.96,161.55,"works is order eight. And, son of a gun,"
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,161.55,164.91000000000003,look what it did. It hit every single
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,164.91,167.10999999999999,point dead on in the center. Boom. Boom. Boom.
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,167.11,168.44000000000003,Boom. It used all the degrees of freedom
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,168.44,170.95,it had to reduce the error to essentially zero.
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,170.95,172.03,>> Excellent.
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,172.03,174.91,">> So [LAUGH], one could argue that this is a really"
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,174.91,178.09,"good idea. Though, if you look at what happens around 9000,"
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,178.09,180.96,there's some craziness. Do you see that?
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,180.96,181.22,>> I do.
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,181.22,186.51,">> At the Yeah, the To try to get this particular parabola"
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,186.51,191.38,"to hit that particular point, it sent the curve soaring down with an up again."
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,191.38,196.319,">> We also did that between 6500 and 8500, it sent [CROSSTALK]."
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,196.319,196.88799999999998,>> Yes good point
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,196.888,197.854,>> [UNKNOWN] [CROSSTALK]
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,197.854,203.17000000000002,">> Right, right, that's right went off the top of the plot. So Yeah,"
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,203.17,206.66,"that's kind of [INAUDIBLE]. But let's just, just to show that we really"
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,206.66,209.32,"are, as we have more degrees of freedom we're fitting the error better."
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,209.32,211.95,"Let me show you what it looks like, the amount of error for"
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,211.95,215.47,"the best fit for each of these orders of k. Alright and so, so"
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,215.47,219.37,"what you see when we actually plot the, the squared error, this function"
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,219.37,222.01,that we're trying to minimize. As we go from order zero to order
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,222.01,224.14,"one, order two, order three, order four, order five, all the way to"
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,224.14,227.70999999999998,"eight. By eight, there is no error left because it nailed every single point."
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,229.16,231.93,"So you know its kind of a good, nut it doesn't feel quite"
JAMf1QWpcWs,Order of Polynomial,231.93,234.54000000000002,right like the curves that we're looking there looked a little bit crazy.

Good."

a little bit about the philosophy of"

zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,19.145,22.245,"So what we wanted to kind of get across
today was a little bit about why we,"
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,22.245,24.3,the class is structured the way it is.
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,24.3,25.07,What the different parts are.
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,25.07,26.830000000000002,And maybe go a little bit of back and
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,26.83,30.189,"forth about what we think you should
be getting out of the course."
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,30.189,30.886,That seem reasonable?
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,30.886,31.49,>> Sure.
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,31.49,32.275999999999996,">> Okay.
Well, so,"

started, I wanted to thank you for"

joining me in these beautiful, studios."

it's very nice to be here."

coming, Michael."

asking me to do the course."
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,44.42,45.86,This has been a lot of fun.
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,45.86,47.46,">> Oh, the whole point was to be able
to do the course with you, Michael."
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,48.64,51.033,"We like each other, and that's one of
the things that we want you to get,"
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,51.033,53.322,"want to get across in this class,
because we like machine learning."

not sure we completely agree on the most"

why we do the things that we do."
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,61.232,62.235,">> Hm, all right."
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,62.235,64.054,">> So
I think people in the outside world,"
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,64.054,67.042,"Michael, would claim that you're
more theoretical than I am."
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,67.042,67.727,>> In theory.
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,67.727,70.63900000000001,">> In theory, and
I'm more practical than you are."
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,70.639,71.59299999999999,>> Practically.
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,71.593,73.14,>> At least in practice.
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,73.14,76.046,"And hopefully some of that tension
will come out in the class."
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,76.046,78.941,"But I think in order to see why
that tension works that way,"
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,78.941,81.25,"you have to understand
what machine learning is."
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,81.25,81.79,"So, Michael."
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,81.79,82.73,>> Right.
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,82.73,83.60000000000001,>> What's machine learning?
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,83.6,85.53,>> It's about proving theorems.
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,85.53,86.624,>> [LAUGH] No.
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,86.624,88.469,">> No.
>> I would not say it's about proving"
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,88.469,92.00699999999999,"theorems, although proving theorems is
often important in machine learning."
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,92.007,92.888,>> I agree with that.
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,92.888,94.224,">> Okay.
>> So we're on the same page."
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,94.224,95.501,>> We're partially on the same page.
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,95.501,97.299,What is machine learning?
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,97.299,98.45,>> What is machine learning?
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,98.45,99.2,>> Give me a definition.
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,99.2,103.96900000000001,>> So it is computational statistics.
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,103.969,105.40899999999999,How's that for a definition?
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,105.409,106.251,>> That is a definition.
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,106.251,107.89200000000001,It is wrong on so many levels.
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,107.892,110.201,"However, a lot of people would
agree with that statement."
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,110.201,113.877,"They would say that machine learning
is really just applied statistics."
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,113.877,114.83099999999999,>> Not applied statistics.
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,114.831,116.548,Computational statistics.
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,116.548,119.563,>> Computationally applied statistics.
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,119.563,121.284,I don't like that definition.
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,121.284,123.798,I think that it's a bit too narrow.
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,123.798,127.034,"I think that machine learning
is about this broader notion of"
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,127.034,130.687,"building artifacts,
computational artifacts, typically."

based on experience."
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,132.82,135.60999999999999,"And then in particular,
it's not just the act"
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,135.61,139.10100000000003,"of building these artifacts that matter,
it's the math behind it."
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,139.101,140.684,It's the science behind it.
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,140.684,142.663,"It's the engineering behind it,
and it's the computing behind it."
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,142.663,147.324,"It's everything that goes into building
intelligent artifacts that almost by"
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,147.324,149.419,necessity have to learn over time.
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,149.419,150.73000000000002,You buy that?
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,150.73,153.75,">> Yeah, so you, you have data, and
you do analysis of the data and"
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,153.75,154.968,try to glean things from the data.
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,154.968,160.85,"And you used, various kinds of
computational structure to do that,"
zA5QNkJspxY,intro to charles and michael,160.85,162.71,"so, computational statistics."

LQbxOm_L5OM,Pick the Degree Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,25.56,32.223,"It's because zero, one and two seem to make quite a few errors."

nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,0.28,2.75,Alright. So we talked through how it works when you've got
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,4.84,7.689,"you're trying to fit your data to a constant function,"
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,7.689,10.379999999999999,"to a zero order polynomial. But let's, let's at least talk"
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,10.38,12.3,through how you do this in the more general case. This
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,12.3,14.59,"is, this is what I've been doing to, to fit various"
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,14.59,18.65,"curves to the data at least implicitly. So, what we're"
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,18.65,20.72,"really trying to do is we've got a set of data,"
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,20.72,25.32,"x and y. Set n, n examples of x's and their"
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,25.32,30.11,"corresponding y's. And what we're trying to find is these coefficients,"
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,30.11,35.87,"C0, C1, C2, C3. Let's say if we're trying to do cubic regression"
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,35.87,40.72,"where C0 gets added to C1 times x, which gets added to C2 times"
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,40.72,45.31,x squared. Which gets added to C3 times X cubed and we're trying to get
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,45.31,48.42,that to look a lot like y. Now we're not
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,48.42,50.730000000000004,going to get to exactly equal y but let's pretend for a
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,50.73,53.209999999999994,moment that we could. We have a bunch of these
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,53.21,55.63,examples and we want it to work for all of them.
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,55.63,58.93,"So we can arrange all of the, all these"
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,58.93,62.34,"constraints, all these equations into matrix form. If you're familiar"
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,62.34,64.709,with linear algebra. So the way that we can
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,64.709,68.41,"write this is here are the, here are the coefficients"
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,68.41,71.22,"that we're looking for, the C's, and here are"
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,71.22,73.21,what we're going to multiply them by. We're going to take
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,73.21,77.36,"the X one and look at the zeroth power,"
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,77.36,81.64,"the second power, the third power. And that equation I'll"
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,81.64,84.37,"use my hands cause that's I always, I always"
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,84.37,86.38000000000001,need to use my hands when I do matrix
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,86.38,89.99,multiplication. So you're going to across here and down there
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,89.99,93.22,to multiply these and add. And that needs to correspond
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,93.22,97.73,to y1. And same thing this now the second
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,97.73,101.79,row. Multiplied by these coefficients. Need to give us our
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,101.79,104.53,y2 and so forth. Alright. So if we arrange
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,104.53,106.73,"all these x values into a matrix, and we'll call"
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,106.73,114.35000000000001,"it, you know, x. And then we have these other guys. And we'll call this w, like"
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,114.35,118.44999999999999,the coefficents. Obviously w stands for coefficent. And we
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,118.45,121.52,want that to sort of equal This vector of
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,121.52,124.02,y's. And we basically just need to solve
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,124.02,127.19,"this equation for the w's. Now, we can't exactly"
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,127.19,129.57,"solve it because it's not going to exactly equal, but"
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,129.57,131.82,we can solve it in a least squares sense.
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,131.82,134.41,So let me just step through the steps for doing that.
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,134.41,137.47,"Alright, so let's, so here's how we're going to solve for w."
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,137.47,140.5,So what we're going to do is premultiply by the transpose of
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,140.5,144.5,x. Both sides. I mean really what we wanted to do at
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,144.5,146.27,"first is if we are solving for Y, we need to"
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,146.27,148.37,"multiply by the inverse of X, but this isn't really going"
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,148.37,151.47,to be necessarily well behaved. But if we pre mulitplied by
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,151.47,156.17,the X transpose then this thing is going to have a nice inverse.
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,157.29,159.97,So now we can pre multiply by that inverse.
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,159.97,162.3,"All right. Now, conveniently because this has a nice"
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,162.3,166.47,"inverse, the inverses cancel each other. [NOISE] We get"
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,166.47,169.08,that the weights we're looking for can be derived by
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,169.08,173.67000000000002,"taking the x matrix times its own transpose, inverting"
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,173.67,176.57999999999998,"that, multiplying by x transpose and then multiplying it"
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,176.58,178.4,by the y. And that gives us exactly the
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,178.4,183.48000000000002,coefficients that we need To have done our polynomial regression.
nGcMl03LPC0,Polynomial Regression,183.48,187.17,"And it just, it just so happens that we have some nice properties in terms"

sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,0.5,3.31,"Alright, so let me try to get to this concept"
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,3.31,6.609999999999999,"of cross validation. So, imagine that we've got our data,"
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,6.61,9.96,"this is our training set. We can, again, picture geometrically"
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,9.96,13.48,"in the case of regression. And, ultimately what we're trying"
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,13.48,15.84,to do is find a way of predicting values and
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,15.84,20.5,"then testing them. So, what we imagine is we do"
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,20.5,22.31,some kind of regression and we might want to fit
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,22.31,25.57,"this too a line. And, you know, the line is"
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,25.57,27.59,"good, it kind of captures what's going on and if we"
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,27.59,30.32,"apply this to the testing set, maybe it's going to do"
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,30.32,35.17,"a pretty good job. But, if we are, you know, feeling"
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,35.17,39.22,kind of obsessive compulsive about it we might say well in
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,39.22,41.46,this particular case we didn't actually track all the ups and
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,41.46,45.18,downs of the data. So what can we do in terms
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,45.18,47.44,"of if we, if we fit it with the line and"
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,47.44,51.12,the errors not so great. What else could we switch to Charles?
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,51.12,54.25,">> We could just use the test. No, sorry. What, what I mean"
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,54.25,58.5,"is if we fit, we fit this to a line and we're sort"

sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,76.24,78.58999999999999,"this kind of, kind of other shape, and now it's doing this, it's"
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,78.59,83.72,"making weird predictions in certain places. So, really what we'd like to"
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,83.72,85.94,"do is, and what was your suggestion? If we trained on the"

sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,101.54,107.31,"at all, is it? [LAUGH] If we exactly fit the, the test set, then"
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,107.31,110.92,again that's not going to generalize to how we use it in the real world.
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,110.92,115.47,>> So the goal is always to generalize. The test set is just

sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,131.774,135.97,.Actually makes sense unless we believe that somehow the

sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,139.35,141.51999999999998,">> Yes, that's a very good point, that"
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,141.52,144.31,we are assuming that this data is representative of
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,144.31,147.36,how the system is ultimately going to be used. In
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,147.36,152.60000000000002,"fact, there's an abbreviation that statisticians like to use."
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,152.6,155.23,"That the data, we really count on"

sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,158.9,159.465,>> Mm-hm.
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,159.465,161.65,">> which is to say that all the data that we have collected,"
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,161.65,164.59,"it's all really coming from the same source, so there is no, no"
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,164.59,167.44,sort of weirdness that the training set looks different from testing set looks
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,167.44,170.47,different from the world but they are all drawn from the same distribution.
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,171.62,173.96,>> So would you call that a fundamental assumption of supervised learning?

sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,181.23,181.48999999999998,>> Fair enough.

sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,201.36,203.33,like to use a model that's complex enough to actually
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,203.33,205.95000000000002,"model the structure that's in the data that we're training on,"
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,205.95,209.10999999999999,"but no so complex that it's, it's matching that so directly that"
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,209.11,211.85000000000002,it doesn't really work well on the test set. But unfortunately we
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,211.85,215.32,"don't really have the test set to play with because that again,"
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,215.32,218.45,"is going to, it's too much teaching to the test. We need"
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,218.45,221.69,to actually learn the true structure that is going to need to
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,221.69,225.57,"be generalized. So, so how do we find out. How can we,"
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,225.57,228.47,how can we pick a model that is complex enough to model
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,228.47,232.10999999999999,the data while making sure that it hasn't started to kind of diverege in
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,232.11,235.94000000000003,terms of how it's going to be applied to the test set. If we don't
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,235.94,238.89,"have access to the test set, is there something that we can use in"
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,238.89,243.2,the training set that we could have it kind of act like a test set?
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,243.2,248.72,">> Well, we could take some of the training"
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,248.72,253.57,data and pretend its a test set and that wouldn't be cheating because its
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,253.57,255.23,not really the test set.
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,255.23,258.76,">> Excellent. Indeed, right, so there's nothing magic"
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,258.76,262.62,about the training set all needing to be
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,262.62,268.76,"used to fit the coefficient. It could be that we hold out some of it ,as"
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,268.76,273.34999999999997,"a kind of make pretend test set, a test test set, a trial test set, a"
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,273.35,275.119,what we're going to say cross validation set.
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,276.22,278.70000000000005,And it's going to be a stand in for the
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,278.7,283.14,"actual test data. That we can actually, make"
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,283.14,286.15999999999997,use of that doesn't involve actually using the test
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,286.16,288.05,data directly which is ultimately going to be
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,288.05,291.43,"cheating. So, this cross validation set is going to"
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,291.43,293.16,be really helpful in figuring out what to
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,293.16,296.61,"do. So. Alright, so here's how we're going to do"
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,296.61,299.28000000000003,"this, this concept of cross validation. We're going to take"
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,299.28,304.39,"our training data, and we're going to split it into"
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,304.39,306.89,what are called folds. I'm not actually sure why they're
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,306.89,309.7,called folds. I don't know if that's a sheep reference.
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,309.7,312.64,>> Why would it be a sheep reference?
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,312.64,316.06,>> I think there's a sheep-related concept that is called a
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,316.06,319.47,"fold. Like, You know, we're going to bring you back into the fold."
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,319.47,319.81,>> Oh.
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,319.81,321.79,">> It's like the, it's like the group of sheep."
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,321.79,324.90000000000003,>> You are just trunk full of knowledge.
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,324.9,327.08,>> Alright so what we're going to do is train
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,327.08,329.59999999999997,"on the first three folds, and use the fourth one"
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,329.6,333.14000000000004,"to, to see how we did. Train on the [LAUGH]"
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,333.14,335.41999999999996,second there and fourth fold and check on the first
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,335.42,337.43,one. And we're going to we're going to try all these different
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,337.43,340.55,"combinations leaving out each fold as a kind of a,"
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,340.55,343.96500000000003,a fake test set. And then average these errors. The
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,343.965,347.84999999999997,",uh, the, the goodness of fit. Average them all together,"
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,347.85,352.27000000000004,"to see how well we've done. And, the model class,"
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,352.27,355.14,so like the degree of the polynomial in this case that
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,355.14,358.33,"does the best job, the lowest error, is the"
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,358.33,361.07,"one that we're going to go with. Alright, so if"
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,361.07,362.71999999999997,"this is a little bit abstract still let me,"
sFO2ff-gTh0,Cross Validation,362.72,365.59000000000003,let me ground this back out in the housing example.
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,0.91,2.58,Alright so here's how we're going to look at this. So as
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,2.58,7.11,"you may recall, in this housing example. If we look at different"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,7.11,9.84,degrees of polynomials and how well they fit the data. Let's
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,9.84,13.15,look at the training error. The per example training error. So how
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,13.15,15.812000000000001,far off is it for each of the data points? And
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,15.812,19.396,as we increase the degree of the polynomial from constant to linear
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,19.396,22.276,"to quadratic and all the way up to, when this case"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,22.276,25.92,"order six, the error's always falling. As you go up, you have"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,25.92,28.080000000000002,"more ability to fit the data, closer and closer and"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,28.08,30.93,"closer, right? because, each of these models is, is nested"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,30.93,33.22,inside the other. We can always go back. If the
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,33.22,37.07,"zero fits best and I give you six degrees of freedom,"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,37.07,40.42,"you can still fit the zero. So, that's what happens"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,40.42,42.24,"with the training error, but now let's use this idea"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,42.24,44.6,of cross validation to say what if we split the
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,44.6,51.19,data up into chunks and have each chunk being predicted by
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,51.19,53.169999999999995,"the, the rest of the data? Train on the rest of the"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,53.17,56.61,"data, predict on the chunk. Repeat that for all the different chunks"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,56.61,61.66,"and average together. So, so I actually did that. And this is"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,61.66,65.33,what I got with the cross validation error. So there's a I
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,65.33,67.44,don't know there's a couple of interesting things to note about this
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,67.44,69.81,"plot. So that we see, we have this red plot that is"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,69.81,73.64,constantly falling and the blue plot which is the cross validation error
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,73.64,76.36,"starts out a little bit higher than the, the red plot that's"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,76.36,79.21,"got higher error. So, why do you think that is Charles?"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,79.21,80.61999999999999,>> Well that makes sense right?
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,80.62,83.5,because we're actually training to minimize error.
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,83.5,87.42,We're actually trying to minimize error on the training set. So the parts we
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,87.42,90.19,"aren't looking at, you're more likely to have some error with. That makes sense"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,90.19,92.45,if you'd have a little bit more error on the data you haven't seen.
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,92.45,95.99000000000001,">> Right, so, good. So, so, in the, on the, this red curve. We're"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,95.99,99.72,actually predicting predicting all the different data
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,99.72,101.91,points using all of those same data points.
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,101.91,104.53,So it is using all the data to predict that data. This
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,104.53,107.14,"blue point, which is really only a little bit higher in this case,"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,107.14,110.59,"is using, in this particular case I used all but one of the"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,110.59,114.842,examples to predict the remaining example. But it doesn't have that example when
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,114.842,118.05,"it's, when it's doing its fitting. So it's really predicting on a new"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,118.05,120.732,example that it hasn't seen. And so of course you'd expect it to
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,120.732,123.44,"be a little bit worse. In this particular case, the averages are all"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,123.44,126.87,"pretty much the same so there's not a big difference. But now, let's,"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,126.87,128.68,let's look at what happens as we start to increase the
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,128.68,131.75,"degree, we've got the ability to fit this data better and"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,131.75,135.332,"better and better, and, in fact, down at you know say,"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,135.332,138.98,"three and four, they're actually pretty close in terms of their"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,138.98,143.63,"ability to, to, to fit these examples. And then what's great,"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,143.63,146.64,what's really interesting is what happens is now we start to
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,146.64,148.89,"give it more, the ability to fit the data closer and"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,148.89,152.04199999999997,"closer. And by the time we get up to, to order six"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,152.042,154.87,"polynomial, even though the error on the training set is"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,154.87,157.47,"really low, the error on this, on this cross validation"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,157.47,161.32,"error, the error that you, that you're measuring by predicting"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,161.32,165.48,"the examples that you haven't seen, is really high. And this"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,165.48,168.70999999999998,"is beautiful this, this inverted u, is, is exactly what"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,168.71,170.82000000000002,you tend to see in these kinds of cases. That
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,170.82,173.78,the error decreases as you have more power and then
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,173.78,177.08,it starts to increase as you use too much [LAUGH] of
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,177.08,180.28,that power. Does that make sense to you?
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,180.28,183.74,">> It does make sense, so. The, the problem is that as"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,183.74,185.93,we give it more and more power we're able to fit the
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,185.93,189.53,data. But as it gets more and more and more power it
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,189.53,196.26,tends to over fit the training data at the expense of future generalization.
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,196.26,198.76,">> Right. So that's exactly how we, we referred to this is this"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,198.76,202.01999999999998,"sort of idea that if you don't give yourself enough degrees of freedom,"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,202.02,205.25,you don't give yourself a model class that's powerful enough you
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,205.25,207.68,will underfit the data. You won't be able to model what's actually
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,207.68,210.44,going on and there'll be a lot of error. But if you
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,210.44,213.60999999999999,give yourself too much you can overfit the data. You can actually
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,213.61,216.85000000000002,start to model the error and it generalizes very poorly to
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,216.85,221.41,unseen examples. And somewhere in between is kind of the goldilocks zone.
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,221.41,222.75,"Where we're not underfitting, and we're"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,222.75,225.29,not overfitting. We're fitting just right.
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,225.29,227.2,And that's the point that we really want to find. We want to
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,227.2,230.82,"find the model that fits the data without overfitting, and not underfitting."
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,230.82,232.79,">> So what was the answer on the, housing exam?"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,232.79,235.44,">> Well, so, it seems pretty clear in this,"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,235.44,237.99,"in this plot that it's somewhere, it's either three or"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,237.99,239.66,"four. It turns out, if you look at the"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,239.66,242.7,"actual numbers, three and four are really close. But three"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,242.7,244.38,is a little bit lower. So three is actually
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,244.38,246.19,"the thing that fits it the best. And, in fact,"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,246.19,248.43,if you look at what four does. It fits the
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,248.43,252.34,"data by more or less zeroing out the, the quartic"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,252.34,254.55,"term, right? It doesn't really use the, this power."
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,254.55,256.779,">> Oh, but that's interesting. So that means"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,256.779,259.94,"it, it barely uses the, the, the extra degree"
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,259.94,262.079,of freedom you give it. But even using it
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,262.079,264.88,"a little bit, it still does worse than generalization."
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,264.88,266.85,>> Just a tiny bit worse.
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,266.85,266.91,>> Huh.
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,266.91,267.75,>> Yup exactly so.
lvJzg6SJXbw,Housing Example Revisited,267.75,269.56,>> That's actually kind of cool.
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,0.18,1.46,Alright. Up to this point I've been talking
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,1.46,3.969,about regression in the context of a scalar
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,3.969,7.98,input and continuous output. Sorry. Scalar input and
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,7.98,11.88,continuous input. So basically this x variable. But
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,11.88,15.73,the truth of the matter is we could actually have vector inputs as well. So what
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,15.73,17.490000000000002,"would might, what might be an example of"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,17.49,19.439999999999998,where we might want to use a vector input?
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,19.44,21.68,>> A couple of things. One if you look at
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,21.68,25.18,"the housing example, like we said earlier, there are a bunch"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,25.18,26.63,of features that we weren't keeping track off.
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,26.63,28.169999999999998,So we could have added some of those.
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,28.17,30.53,">> Great yeah, we could include more input features"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,30.53,33.34,and therefore combine more things to get it. But how
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,33.34,36.010000000000005,"would we do that? So let's say for example,"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,36.01,40.05,that we have. Two input variables that we think might
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,40.05,42.489999999999995,"be relevant for figuring out housing costs. The size,"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,42.49,44.81,"which we've been looking at already, But also let's say"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,44.81,47.24,"the distance to the nearest zoo. We, we think that"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,47.24,50.230000000000004,that's a really important thing. People like to live close
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,50.23,51.459999999999994,to the zoo and so.
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,51.46,54.138,>> But probably not too close to the zoo.
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,54.138,57.6,>> [LAUGH] Possibly not too close to the zoo. But let's let's imagine that
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,57.6,60.43,"it's like size, something that actually Or"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,60.43,61.71,"actually, let, let's do it the other way,"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,61.71,66.24,"let's sort of imagine that, that, that the further away from the zoo, you are,"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,66.24,69.19,"the better it is. Just like the bigger the size is, the better it is."
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,69.19,69.551,>> Mm-hm.
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,69.551,72.03,>> So how do we combine these two variables into one
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,72.03,75.34,in the context of the kinds of function classes that we've
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,75.34,76.02000000000001,been talking about?
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,76.02,77.32,">> Well, if you think about lines, we can"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,77.32,81.13999999999999,"just generalize the planes and hyper planes. Right so,"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,81.14,84.01,"in the case of, of a 1 dimensional input."
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,84.01,87.41000000000001,"That 1, 1 dimensional input gets mapped to the cost."
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,88.65,91.11,"But in the case of 2 dimensional inputs, like"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,91.11,94.16,size and distance to the zoo. We have something that's
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,94.16,96.74,"more like a plane, combining these two things together"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,96.74,101.50999999999999,"in, in the linear fashion to actually predict what the."
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,101.51,104.47,"Cost is going to be. So right, so these,"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,104.47,107.53,"this notion of linear functions generalizes, this notion of polynomial"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,107.53,111.05,"function function generalizes too very, very nicely. All right,"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,111.05,114.58,"there is another kind of input that's important too, that,"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,114.58,116.96,let's think about a slightly different example to help
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,116.96,119.25999999999999,drive the idea home. So let's imagine we are trying
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,119.26,122.66000000000001,"to predict. Credit score, what are some things that"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,122.66,124.5,we might want to use as features to do that.
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,126.39,126.55,>> Do you
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,126.55,127.13,have a job?
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,127.13,128.31,">> I do, actually."
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,128.31,129.788,>> [LAUGH] yes.
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,129.788,131.25,">> Oh, I am sorry, I am sorry,"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,131.25,133.23,"I misunderstood. So you are asking, you are saying"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,133.23,135.25,one [UNKNOWN] that could be important for predicting someone's
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,135.25,136.99,credit score is just to know do they currently
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,136.99,140.45000000000002,have a job. Right another thing might be
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,142.37,144.36,"well you, you can ask instead how much money"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,144.36,146.3,"they actually, how, how much, how many assets they"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,146.3,149.52,have. How much money do they have? Credit cards.
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,149.52,151.84,">> Great. So, so, right. So things"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,151.84,154.93,"like, what is the value of the assets that, that they own,"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,154.93,158.69,right? So this is a continuous quantity like we've been talking about.
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,158.69,160.8,"But something like do you have a job, yes or no, is"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,160.8,163.86,a discreet quantity. And one of the nice things about these kinds of
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,163.86,165.98000000000002,"regression approaches that we've talking about,"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,165.98,168.01999999999998,"like polynomial regression, is that we"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,168.02,171.36,"can actually feed in these discrete variables as well. Certainly if they're,"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,171.36,173.9,"if they're Boolean variables like, do you have a job or not?"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,173.9,177.21,"It, you can just think of that as being a kind of number"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,177.21,179.85,"that's just zero or one. No, I don't have a job. Yes, I have"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,179.85,183.6,"a job. What if it's something like, you know, how many houses do you own?"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,183.6,183.67,>> Hmm.
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,183.67,186.20999999999998,">> That's pretty easy because that's, you could just treat that"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,186.21,192.31,"as a As a quantity, a scalar type quantity. What about"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,192.31,192.7,>> Are you.
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,192.7,193.63,>> Type of job.
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,193.63,197.04,">> Type of job, I like that. How about hair color?"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,197.04,200.51,">> So, yeah, how would we do that? If we,"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,200.51,202.28,if we're trying to feed it in to some kind of
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,202.28,204.22,"regression type algorithm, it needs to be a"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,204.22,205.85,"number or a vector of numbers, and they can"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,205.85,208.14,be discrete. So right. So how do we
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,208.14,210.19,encode this as some kind of a numerical value?
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,210.19,213.38,">> Well, we could do something ridiculous like actually write"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,213.38,217.39,down the RGB value which would make it kind of continuous.
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,217.39,219.32999999999998,>> Interesting.
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,219.33,221.32000000000002,">> That seems insane, but you could do that. Or you could just"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,221.32,224.85999999999999,enumerate them and just assign them values one through six in this case.
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,227.16,229.51,"Right, 1, 2, 6 or they could be vectors like,"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,229.51,231.23,"is it red, yes or no? Is it beige, yes or"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,231.23,232.67999999999998,"no? Is it brown, yes or no? Have it be"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,232.68,237.53,a vector and actually for different kinds of discreet quantities like
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,237.53,240.28,"this it can make it different, right? So in particular"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,240.28,243.43,if we just gave the numbers. Then it's kind of signalling
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,243.43,247.54000000000002,"to the algorithm that blonde is halfway between brown and black,"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,247.54,252.39,which doesn't really make sense. We could reorder these. Actually the
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,252.39,254.20999999999998,RGB idea doesn't seem so bad to me.
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,254.21,257.14,">> [UNKNOWN] of course, you have an interesting question of what's the"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,257.14,261.97999999999996,real RGB value. It implies that somehow interpreting between them Make sense.
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,261.98,263.38,">> That's right, that's right."
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,263.38,266.05,>> It also implies an order right. It implies that the
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,266.05,270.86,scalar order of RGB is somehow mean something that it's no
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,270.86,273.92,"different from saying red is one and beige is two. So,"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,273.92,277.48,"if we multiply it, for example, by a positive coefficient then"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,277.48,281.6,"the more RGB you have The better or the worse, right?"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,281.6,285.06,">> Hmm. Interesting. Though, in fact what I had in"
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,285.06,288.54,"mind here is for RGB, it's three different hair colors."
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,288.54,298.332,>> I thought the g stood for green.
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,298.332,299.018,">> There's, people don't have green hair, they have gray hair."
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,299.018,299.40999999999997,>> But I thought the g in RGB stood for
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,299.41,302.88500000000005,green. Yeah it does usually but I'm making a hair joke.
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,302.885,304.19,[LAUGH]
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,304.19,308.44,>> Oh oh. I am sorry. I am glad you explained that. You know Michael.
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,308.44,309.11,>> No problem sir.
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,309.11,311.09000000000003,">> I really, I really like the [UNKNOWN] factor idea."
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,311.09,313.03999999999996,>> Yeah so I think. I think. I imaging that we are going to
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,313.04,314.56,return to this issues when we start
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,314.56,317.35,actually encoding problems as mission learning problems.
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,317.35,318.66,>> I think your right.
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,318.66,320.41,>> But I think that's I think
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,320.41,322.32000000000005,that's said about regression for the time being.
p0opXBswvWo,Other Input Spaces,322.32,323.04,>> I agree.

L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,0.34,1.705,Hey Charles. How's it goin'?
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,1.705,3.81,>> It's going pretty well Michael. How are things going with you?
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,3.81,7.470000000000001,>> Good. You know I'm excited to tell you about neural networks today.
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,7.47,11.18,"You may be familiar with neural networks because you have one, in your head."
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,11.18,12.55,>> I do?
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,12.55,15.93,">> Well, yeah. I mean, you have a network neurons. Like, you know,"
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,15.93,19.15,"you know neurons, like brain cells. Let me, let me, I'll draw you one."
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,19.15,20.31,>> Okay.
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,20.31,22.759999999999998,">> So this is my template drawing, a nerve cell,"
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,22.76,26.290000000000003,"a neuron. And you can, you know, you've got billions and"
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,26.29,29.18,billions of these inside your head. And they have
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,29.18,30.46,"you know, most of them have a pretty similar"
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,30.46,32.759,"structure, that there's the, there's the kind of the"
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,32.759,35.68,main part of the cell called the cell body. And
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,35.68,41.19,then there's this thing called an axon which kind of is like a wire going
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,41.19,46.879999999999995,forward to a set of synapses which are kind of little gaps between
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,46.88,51.940000000000005,"this neuron and some other neuron. And what happens is, information spike"
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,51.94,52.43,trains
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,52.43,53.54,>> Woo woo!
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,53.54,57.269999999999996,>> Travel down the axon. When the
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,57.27,59.78,cell body fires it has an electrical impulse
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,59.78,62.09,"it travels down the, the, the axon"
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,62.09,66.22,and then causes across the synapses excitation to
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,66.22,68.24,occur on other neurons which themselves can
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,68.24,71.86,fire. Again by sending out spike trains. And
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,71.86,73.89,so they're very much a kind of
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,73.89,77.82000000000001,"a computational unit and they're very, very complicated."
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,77.82,80.6,"To a first approximation, as is often true with"
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,80.6,83.74,first approximations they're very simple. Sort of by definition
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,83.74,86.75,"of first approximation. So what, what, in the field"
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,86.75,89.71,of artificial neural networks we have kind of a
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,89.71,94.63999999999999,cartoonish version of the neuron and networks of neurons
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,94.64,97.82000000000001,and we actually. Put them together to compute various
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,97.82,100.16999999999999,"things. And one of the nice things about the,"
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,100.17,103.01,the way that they're set up is that they
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,103.01,106.30000000000001,can be tuned or changed so that they fire under
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,106.3,109.74,different conditions and therefore compute different things. And they can
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,109.74,112.32,be trained through a learning process. So that's what we're
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,112.32,114.61,going to talk through if you haven't heard about this before.
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,114.61,115.88,>> Okay.
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,115.88,118.25,>> So we can replace this sort of detailed version of a
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,118.25,120.97,neuron with a very abstracted way kind of notion of a neuron.
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,120.97,124.95,And here's how it's going to work. We're going to have inputs
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,124.95,128.56,"that are kind of you know, think of them as firing rates or"
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,130.139,135.47,"the strength of inputs. X1, X2, and X3 in this case. Those are"
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,135.47,140.79,"multiplied by weight, w1, w2, w3 correspondingly. And so the weights"
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,140.79,145.98999999999998,"kind of turn up the gain or the sensitivity of the neuron, this unit,"
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,148.8,152.20000000000002,to each of the inputs respectively. Then what we're going to do is
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,152.2,156.97,we're going to sum them up. So we're going to sum. Over all the inputs.
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,159.64,162.75,"The strength of the input times the weight,"
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,162.75,165.42,and that's going to be the activation. Then
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,165.42,167.32,"we're going to ask is that greater than,"
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,167.32,170.37,or equal to the firing threshold. And if it
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,170.37,177.31,"is, then we're going to say the output is one, and if it's not, we're going to"
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,177.31,179.42000000000002,say the output is zero. So this is
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,179.42,184.79999999999998,a particular kind of neural net unit called Perceptron.
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,184.8,187.88000000000002,Which is a very sexy name because they had very sexy names in the 50s
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,187.88,189.94,>> They did.
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,189.94,193.27,>> When this was first developed. Alright?
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,193.27,195.5,"So this, this whole neuron concept gets"
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,195.5,199.97,"boiled down to something much simpler, which is just, a linear sum followed by"
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,199.97,202.96,"a threshold, thresholding operation, right? So it's"
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,202.96,205.41,"worth kind of thinking, how can we,"
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,205.41,210.16,"what sort of things can this, can networks of these kinds of units compute? So,"
L_6idb3ZXB0,Neural Networks,210.16,212.12,let's see if we can figure some of those things out.

VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,0.48,1.68,Alright. Well we'd like to try to get an
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,1.68,5.43,understanding of how powerful one of these perceptron units are.
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,5.43,8.07,"So, what is it that they actually do? So"
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,8.07,12.66,"they, they return, in this case either 0 or 1"
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,12.66,14.870000000000001,as a function of a bunch of inputs. So
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,14.87,17.9,"let's just for simplicity of visualization, let's just imagine that"
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,17.9,20.84,"we've got 2 inputs, X1 and X2. So Charles,"
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,20.84,25.759999999999998,how could we represent the region in this input space
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,25.76,27.700000000000003,that is going to get an output of 0
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,27.7,29.689999999999998,versus the region that's going to get an output of 1.
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,29.69,30.580000000000002,>> Order the weights.
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,30.58,32.46,">> Right. So indeed, the weights matter. So"
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,32.46,34.67,"let's, let's give some concrete values to these weights."
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,34.67,40.13,"And let's just say, just making these up that weight 1 is a half, weight 2 is a"
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,40.13,42.910000000000004,"half, and our threshold data is three quarters. So"
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,42.91,44.75,"now what we want to do is again, break"
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,44.75,47.77,"up this, this space into where's it going to"
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,47.77,50.92,return 1 and where's it going to return 0.
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,50.92,55.64,">> Okay, so I think I know how to figure this out. So, there's kind of"
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,55.64,60.79,"an, there's 2 sort of extreme examples, so let's take a case where X1 is 0."
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,60.79,65.351,">> X1 is 0. Okay, good. So that's this Y axis, uh-huh."
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,65.351,69.24,">> Alright. So if X1 is 0, what value would X2 have to be in"
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,69.24,74.55,"order to break a threshold of three quarters? Well, the weight on X2 is a half."
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,74.55,75.13,>> Mm-hm.
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,75.13,76.22,">> So then,"
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,76.22,79.09,the value of X2 would have to be twice as much
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,79.09,81.78,as the threshold which in this case is one and a half.
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,81.78,86.22,">> Right. So we're trying to figure out where is it, if X1 is 0, where"
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,86.22,87.73,does X2 need to be so that we're
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,87.73,89.88000000000001,exactly at the threshold. So that's going to be.
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,89.88,90.75,>> Right.
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,90.75,95.028,">> The X2 times the weight, which is half has to exactly equal the threshold"
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,95.028,101.885,"which is three quarters. So, if we just solve that out, you get X2 equals"
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,101.885,105.58,3 halves. So okay that's this point here. That's going to be
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,105.58,109.36,"a dividing line. So anywhere above here, what's it going to return?"
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,109.36,113.31,">> It will return, it will break the threshold, and so it will return a 1."
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,113.31,115.03,>> These are all going to be 1s and
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,115.03,118.225,then below this these are all going to be 0s.
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,118.225,118.78,>> Right.
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,118.78,121.28,">> Alright. Well now we have a very, very skinny"
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,121.28,124.14,version of the picture. [LAUGH] Well what else can we do?
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,124.14,127.18,>> Well we can do the same thing that we just did except we can swap
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,127.18,130.787,"X2 and X1 because, they have the same weight. So, we could say X2"
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,130.787,134.91,equal to 0 and figure out what the value of X1 has to be.
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,134.91,138.67,">> Good, and that seems like it would be exactly the same algebra, and so"
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,138.67,142.13,"we get X1 is 3 halves, gives us at the one and a half point"
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,142.13,146.1,"above here are going to be 1s and below here are going to be 0s. Okay, so now"
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,146.1,152.41,"we've got 2 very narrow windows, but what we notice is that the relationships"
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,152.41,157.32999999999998,are all linear here. So solving this linear inequality gets us a picture like
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,157.33,163.19000000000003,"this. So this perceptron computes a kind of half plane right? So, so the half of"
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,163.19,166.51,"the, the plane that's above this line, the half plane thatt's above this line is"
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,166.51,171.53,getting us the 1 answers and below that line is giving us a zero answers.
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,171.53,174.42,">> So Michael can we generalize from this, so"
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,174.42,178.55999999999997,you're telling me then that because of the linear relationship
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,178.56,183.49,drawn out by a perceptron that perceptrons are always going to compute lines.
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,183.49,185.54000000000002,">> Yeah. Always going to compute, yeah"
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,185.54,187.5,these half planes right. So there's a dividing
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,187.5,189.27,line where you're equal to the threshold and
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,189.27,190.52,that's always going to be a linear function
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,190.52,193.39000000000001,"and then it's going to be you know, to the right of it or to"
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,193.39,198.61999999999998,"the left of it, above it or below it but its always halves at that point."
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,198.62,202.172,">> Okay, so perception is a linear function, and it computes hyperplanes."
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,202.172,203.59,">> Yeah, which maybe in"
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,203.59,206.5,"some sense it doesn't seem that interesting, but it turns out we're"
VwCMm3llk1s,How Powerful is a Perceptron Unit,206.5,210.49,already in a position to compute something fascinating. So let's do a quiz.

5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,51.41,54.269999999999996,"and we have y's which are zeros and ones which are the,"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,54.27,57.150000000000006,the output that we want to hit. And what we want to do is
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,57.15,62.3,"set the, set the weights so that we capture this, this same data"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,62.3,67.97,"set. And we're going to do that by, modifying the weights over time."
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,67.97,71.92999999999999,">> Oh, Michiel, what's the series of dashes over on the left."
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,71.93,74.80000000000001,">> Oh, sorry, right. I should mention that, so"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,74.8,76.42999999999999,one of the things that we're going to do here is
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,76.43,78.91000000000001,"were going to give a learning rate for the weights W,"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,78.91,82.25999999999999,and not give a learning rule for Theta But we do
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,82.26,84.5,"need to learn the theta. So there's a, there's a very"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,84.5,89.04,convenient trick for actually learning them by just treating it as
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,89.04,92.31,"a, as another kind of weight. So if you think about"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,92.31,94.79,"the way that the, the thresholding function works. We're taking a"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,94.79,97.96000000000001,"linear combination of the W's and X's, then we're comparing it"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,97.96,101.44,"to theta,but if you think about just subtracting theta from both"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,101.44,105.82,"sides, then, in some sense theta just becomes another"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,105.82,108.25,"one of the weights, and we're just comparing to"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,108.25,110.54,"zero. So what, what I did here was took"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,110.54,113.4,"the actual data, the x's, and I added what is"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,113.4,115.92,"sometimes called a, a bias unit to it. So"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,115.92,120.55,"basically, the input is one always to that. And the"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,120.55,123.11999999999999,weight corresponding to it is going to correspond to
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,123.12,126.89,"negative theta ultimately. So, just, just again, this just simplifies"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,126.89,129.66,things so that the threshold can be treated the same
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,129.66,131.54999999999998,"as the weights. So from now on, we don't have"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,131.55,133.37,to worry about the threshold. It just gets folded into
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,133.37,136.48000000000002,"the weights, and all our comparisons are going to be just"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,136.48,140.17,"to zero instead of some, instead of theta. Centric, yeah."
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,141.55,144.72,"It certainly makes the math shorter. So okay, so this"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,144.72,147.23,is what we're going to do. We're going to iterate over this
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,147.23,151.89999999999998,"training set, grabbing an x, which includes the bias piece,"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,151.9,155.55,and the y. Where y is our target X is our
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,155.55,158.46,input. And what we're going to do is we're going to
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,158.46,163.07000000000002,"change weight i, the, the, the weight corresponding to the ith"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,163.07,166.57999999999998,"unit, by the amount that we're changing the weight by. So"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,166.58,169.58,"this is sort of a tautology, right. This is truly just"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,169.58,172.27,saying the amount we've changed the weight by is exactly delta
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,172.27,174.716,W - in other words the amount we've changed the weight
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,174.716,176.79600000000002,by. So we need to define that what that weight change is.
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,176.796,178.97199999999998,The weight change is going to be find as
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,178.972,183.52,"falls. We're going to take the target, the thing that"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,183.52,185.86,we want the output to be. And compare it
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,185.86,189.78,"to, what the network with the current weight actually spits"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,189.78,192.58,"out. So we compute this, this y hat. This"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,192.58,197.24,approximate output y. By again summing up the inputs according
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,197.24,198.88,to the weights and comparing it to zero. That gets
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,198.88,202.04999999999998,us a zero one value.So we're now comparing that to
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,202.05,204.81,"what the actual value is. So what's going to happen here, if"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,204.81,208.6,"they are both zero so let's, let's look at this. Each of"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,208.6,210.84,y and y hat can only be zero and one. If they
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,210.84,214.35,are both zeros then this y minus y hat is zero. If
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,214.35,217.01,they're both ones and what does that mean? It means the output
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,217.01,219.97,should have been zero and the output of our current. Network really
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,219.97,224.85,"was zero, so that's, that's kind of good. If they are both ones,"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,224.85,227.76999999999998,it means the output was supposed to be one and our network outputted
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,227.77,230.57000000000002,"one, and the difference between them is going to be zero. But in"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,230.57,233.76999999999998,"this other case, y minus y hat, if the output was supposed to"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,233.77,236.14000000000001,"be zero, but we said one, our network says one, then we"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,236.14,239.48999999999998,get a negative one. If the output was supposed to be one and
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,239.49,242.03,"we said zero, then we get a positive one. Okay, so those"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,242.03,246.15,are the four cases for what's happening here. We're going to take that value
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,246.15,250.43,"multiply it by the current input to that unit i, scale it"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,250.43,252.79000000000002,down by the sort of thing that is going to be cut the learning
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,252.79,255.66,rate and use that as the the weight update
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,255.66,258.39,change. So essentially what we are saying is if the
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,258.39,261.28999999999996,output is already correct either both on or both
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,261.29,263.49,off. Then there's gong to be no change to the
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,263.49,268.8,"weights. But, if our output is wrong. Let's say"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,268.8,272.54,that we are giving a one when we should have
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,272.54,275.12,"been giving a zero. That means our, the total"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,275.12,277.82,here is too large. And so we need to make
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,277.82,278.92,it smaller. How are we going to make it
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,278.92,285.53000000000003,"smaller? Which ever input XI's correspond too, very large"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,285.53,288.54999999999995,"values, we're going to move those weights very far in"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,288.55,291.08,a negative direction. We're taking this negative one times that
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,291.08,294.52,"value times this, this little learning rate. Alright, the"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,294.52,296.95,other case is if the output was supposed to one
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,296.95,299.15999999999997,"but we're outputting a zero, that means our total"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,299.16,303.11,is too small. And what this rule says is increase
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,303.11,306.32,"the weights essentially to try to make the sum bigger. Now, we"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,306.32,308.59,"don't want to kind of overdo it, and that's what this learning rate"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,308.59,311.60999999999996,is about. Learning rate basically says we'll figure out the direction that
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,311.61,313.81,we want to move things and just take a little step in that
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,313.81,318.95,"direction. We'll keep repeating over all of the, the input output pairs."
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,318.95,321.33,"So, we'll have a chance to get in to really build things up,"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,321.33,323.0,but we're going to do it a little bit at a time so
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,323.0,326.19,we don't overshoot. And that's the
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,326.19,328.05,"rule. It's actually extremely simple. Like, you,"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,328.05,331.79,"actually writing this in code is, is quite trivial. And and"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,331.79,335.63,"yet, it does some remarkable things. So let's imagine for a"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,335.63,337.5,second that we have a training set that looks like this.
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,337.5,340.6,"It's in two dimensions, again, so that it's easy to visualize."
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,340.6,343.96000000000004,"That we've got. A bunch of positive examples, these green x's"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,343.96,346.62,"and we've got a bunch of negative examples these red x's,"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,346.62,350.41,and were trying to learn basically a half plane right? Were
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,350.41,353.07000000000005,trying to learn a half plane that separates the positive from the
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,353.07,357.5,"negative examples. So Charles do you see a, a, half plane"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,357.5,358.9,that we could put in here that would do the trick?
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,358.9,359.87,>> I do.
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,360.98,361.63,>> What would it look like?
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,361.63,362.46999999999997,>> It's that one.
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,362.47,366.115,">> By that one do you mean, this one?"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,366.115,368.88,">> Yeah. That's exactly what I was thinking, Michael."
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,368.88,371.6,">> That's awesome! Yeah, there are isn't, isn't a whole lot"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,371.6,373.94,"of flexibility in what the answer is in this case, if"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,373.94,376.18,we really want to get all greens on one side and all
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,376.18,378.3,the reds on the other. If there is such a half
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,378.3,380.87,"plane that separates the positive from the negative examples, then"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,380.87,384.75,"we say that the data set is linearly separable, right? That"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,384.75,387.59,there is a way of separating the positives and negatives with
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,387.59,391.71,"a line. And what's cool about the perception rule, is that"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,391.71,395.53,if we have data that is linearly separable. The Perceptron Rule
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,395.53,399.08,will find it. It only needs a finite number of iterations
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,399.08,401.2,"to find it. In fact, which I guess is really the"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,401.2,403.77,same as saying that it will actually find it. It won't
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,403.77,407.07,eventually get around to getting to something close to it.
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,407.07,409.08,"It will actually find a line, and it will stop"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,409.08,412.01,"saying okay I now have a set of weights that,"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,412.01,415.52,that do the trick. So that's happens if the data set
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,415.52,419.15,is in fact linearly separable and that's pretty cool. It's
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,419.15,421.13,"pretty amazing that it can do that, it's a very"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,421.13,423.44,"simple rule and it just goes through and iterates and,"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,423.44,427.38,and solves the problem. So. Charles Sened solves the problem. So.
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,427.38,429.34,>> I can think of one.
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,429.34,430.83,What if it is not linearly separable?
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,430.83,435.06,">> Hmm, I see. So, if the data is"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,435.06,437.53000000000003,"linearlly separable, then the algorithm works, so the algorithm"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,437.53,440.29999999999995,simply needs to only be run when the data
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,440.3,443.81,"is linearlly separable. It's generally not that easy tell actually,"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,443.81,445.77,"when your data is linearly separable especially, here we"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,445.77,448.71,"have it in two dimensions, if it's in 50 dimensions,"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,448.71,450.71999999999997,know whether or not there is a setting of
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,450.72,454.74,"those perimeters that makes it linearly separable, not so clear."
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,454.74,457.82,>> Well there is one way you could do it.
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,457.82,458.11,>> Whats that?
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,458.11,464.17,">> You could run this algorithm, and see if it ever stops. I see,"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,464.17,469.28000000000003,"yes of course, there's a problem with that particular scheme, right, which says,"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,469.28,472.14,"well for one thing this algorithm never stops, so wait, we need to, we"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,472.14,480.414,"need to address that. But, but really we should be running this loop here,"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,480.414,485.21,"while, there's some error so I neglected to say that"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,485.21,487.34999999999997,before. But what you'll notice is if you continue to run
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,487.35,490.47,this after the point where it's getting all the answers right.
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,490.47,493.11,It found a set of weights that lineally separate the positive
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,493.11,495.64,and negative instances what will happen is when it gets
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,495.64,499.28999999999996,to this delta w line that y minus y hat will
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,499.29,502.37,always be zero the weights will never change we'll go back
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,502.37,505.51,and update them by adding zero to them repeatedly over and
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,505.51,509.3,over again. So. If it ever does reach zero
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,509.3,511.85,"error, if it ever does separate the data set"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,511.85,513.25,then we can just put a little condition in
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,513.25,515.02,there and tell it to stop filtering So what you
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,515.02,519.1899999999999,are suggesting is that we could run this algorithm
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,519.19,520.4290000000001,and if it stops then we know that it is
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,520.429,523.9499999999999,linearly separable and if it doesn't stop Then we
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,523.95,526.76,"know that it's not linearly separable, right? By this guarantee."
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,526.76,526.98,>> Sure.
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,526.98,530.4200000000001,">> The problem is we, we don't know when finite is done, right?"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,530.42,534.89,"If, if this were like 1,000 iterations, we could run it for 1,000 if it wasn't"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,534.89,538.55,"done. It's not done, but all we know at this point is that it's a finite number"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,538.55,540.3499999999999,"of iterations, and so that could be a"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,540.35,542.44,"thousand, 10 thousand, a million, ten million, we"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,542.44,544.1,"don't know, so we never know when to"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,544.1,546.98,stop and declare the data set not linearly separable.
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,546.98,548.2,">> Hmm, so if we could do that,"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,548.2,550.46,"then we would have solved the halting problem, and"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,550.46,553.19,"we would all have nobel prizes Well, that's"
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,553.19,555.49,not necessarily the case. But it's certainly the other
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,555.49,557.26,direction is true. That if we could solve
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,557.26,558.8,"the halting problem, then we could solve this."
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,558.8,559.54,>> Hm.
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,559.54,560.99,>> But it could be that this problem
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,560.99,563.16,might be solvable even without solving the halting problem.
5g0TPrxKK6o,Perceptron Training,563.16,564.64,>> Fair enough. Okay.
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,0.34,5.038,>> So we are going to need a learning algorithm that is more robust to
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,5.038,10.68,non-linear separability or linear non-separability. Does that sound right?
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,10.68,16.32,>> Non-linear separability. Non linear separability.
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,16.32,17.28,>> Non?
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,17.28,17.77,>> Yeah think of it.
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,17.77,20.47,">> Left parenthesis, linear sep, spreadability left parenthesis."
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,20.47,22.34,">> There we go, that's right, negating the whole phrase, very good."
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,22.34,25.35,"So and, Gradient descent is going to give us an algorithm for doing"
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,25.35,27.92,"exactly that. So, what we're going to do now is"
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,29.34,32.59,think of things this way. So what we did before
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,32.59,35.400000000000006,was we had a summation over all the different input features
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,35.4,38.92,"of the activation on that input feature times the weight,"
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,38.92,41.480000000000004,"w, for that input feature. And we sum all"
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,41.48,44.449999999999996,those up and we get an activation. And then we
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,44.45,48.010000000000005,have our estimated output as whether or not that activation
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,48.01,50.53,is greater than or equal to zero. So let's imagine
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,50.53,53.2,"that the output is not thresholded when we're doing the training,"
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,53.2,55.35,and what we're going to do instead is try to figure out
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,55.35,59.38,"the weight so that the Not thresholded value is, as close"
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,59.38,61.81,to the target as we can. So this actually kind of brings
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,61.81,64.459,us back to the regression story. We can define an error
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,64.459,68.39,metric on the weight vector w. And the form of that's
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,68.39,72.12,"going to be one half, times the sum over all the data"
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,72.12,75.75,"in the dataset, of what the target was supposed to be for"
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,75.75,78.79,that particular example minus what the
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,78.79,81.12,activation actually was. Right? The activation
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,81.12,85.32000000000001,being the dot product between the weights and the input and we're
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,85.32,87.53999999999999,going to square that. We're going to square that error and we want to try
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,87.54,90.35000000000001,"to now minimize that. > Hey Michael, can I ask you a question?"
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,90.35,91.47999999999999,>> Sure.
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,91.48,92.59,>> Why one half of that?
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,92.59,97.9,">> Mm. Yes. It turns out that it turn, in terms of"
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,97.9,100.64,minimizing the error this is just a constant and it doesn't matter.
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,101.69,105.45,So why do we stick in a half there? Let's get back to that.
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,105.45,105.82000000000001,>> Okay.
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,105.82,107.97999999999999,>> Just like in the regression case we're going
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,107.98,110.16000000000001,"to fall back to calculus. Right, calculus is going to"
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,110.16,113.36,"tell us how we can push around these weights,"
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,113.36,115.82,"to try to push this error down. Right, so we"
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,115.82,118.1,would like to know. How does changing the weight
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,118.1,120.80999999999999,"change the error, and let's push the weight in the"
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,120.81,123.11,direction that causes the error to go down. So
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,123.11,126.99,"we're going to take the partial derivative of the, this error metric"
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,126.99,129.22,"with respect to each of the individual weights, so that we'll"
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,129.22,131.39,know for each weight which way we should push it a
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,131.39,133.98,little bit to move in the direction of the gradient. So
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,133.98,137.73,"that's the partial dif, dif, [INAUDIBLE] So that's the partial derivitive"
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,137.73,142.54,"with respect to weight wi, of exactly this error measure. So"
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,142.54,145.20999999999998,to take this partial derivitive we just use the chain rule
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,145.21,148.53,as we always do. And what is it to take the
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,148.53,151.92,"derivitive of something like this, if you have this quantity here."
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,151.92,155.16,"We take the power, move it to the front, keep this"
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,155.16,158.10999999999999,"thing, and then take the derivitive of this thing. But that,"
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,158.11,160.46,"so this now answers your question, Charles. Why do we put"
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,160.46,162.78,"a half in there? Because down the line, it's going to be"
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,162.78,165.97,"really convenient that two and the half canceled out. So, it's"
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,165.97,168.7,"just going to mean that our partial derivative is going to look simpler,"
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,168.7,171.76,even though our error measure looked a little bit more complicated.
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,171.76,176.98999999999998,"So so what we're left with then, is exactly what I said,"
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,176.99,179.02,the sum over all these data points of what
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,179.02,182.79000000000002,was inside this. Quantity here times the derivative of
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,182.79,186.23999999999998,"that, and here I expanded the a to be,"
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,186.24,189.70000000000002,"the definition of the a. Now, we need to take"
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,189.7,193.72,the partial derivative with respect to weight w i
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,193.72,195.75,of this sum that involves a bunch of the ws
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,195.75,198.27,"in it. So, when don't match the w i,"
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,198.27,201.69,"that derivative is going to be zero because the, you know,"
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,201.69,204.29,changing the weight won't have any impact on it. The only
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,204.29,207.23999999999998,"place where this, changing this weight has any impact is at"
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,207.24,211.02,x of i. So that's what we end up carrying down.
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,211.02,214.39000000000001,This summation disappears. And all that's left is just the one term
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,214.39,217.08999999999997,that matches the weight that we care about. So this is
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,217.09,219.32,what we're left with. Now the derivative of the error with
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,219.32,223.0,"respect to any weight w sub i. Is exactly this, this"
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,223.0,226.99,sum. The sum of the difference between the activation and the target
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,226.99,231.13,output times the activation on that input unit
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,231.13,234.9,">> You know? That looks exactly like, almost exactly"
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,234.9,237.88,like the rule that we use with the rule that we used perceptron before.
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,237.88,239.78,>> It does indeed! What's the
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,239.78,243.25,"difference? Well, actually let's Let's write this"
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,243.25,245.67,"down. This is now just a derivative, but let's actually write down what"
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,245.67,248.45999999999998,our weight update is going to be because we're going to take a little step
1j4bERmqmOU,Gradient Descent,248.46,250.85,in the direction of this derivative and it's going to involve a learning rate.
zgtepSTqzgc,Comparison of Learning Rules,0.53,3.21,So here's our update rules what they end up being.
zgtepSTqzgc,Comparison of Learning Rules,3.21,6.22,The gradient descent rule we just derived says what we
zgtepSTqzgc,Comparison of Learning Rules,6.22,9.3,want to do is more the weights in the negative
zgtepSTqzgc,Comparison of Learning Rules,9.3,12.0,direction of the gradient. So if we negate that expression
zgtepSTqzgc,Comparison of Learning Rules,12.0,14.41,that we had before and take a little step in
zgtepSTqzgc,Comparison of Learning Rules,14.41,18.21,that direction we get exactly this expression. Multiply the. The
zgtepSTqzgc,Comparison of Learning Rules,18.21,22.61,input on that weight times the target minus the activation.
zgtepSTqzgc,Comparison of Learning Rules,22.61,25.81,Whereas in the perceptron case what we were doing is taking
zgtepSTqzgc,Comparison of Learning Rules,25.81,28.22,"that same activation, thresholding it. Like,"
zgtepSTqzgc,Comparison of Learning Rules,28.22,30.049999999999997,determining whether it's positive or negative.
zgtepSTqzgc,Comparison of Learning Rules,30.05,32.4,"Putting in a zero or a one. And putting that in here, that's"
zgtepSTqzgc,Comparison of Learning Rules,32.4,35.39,what y hat is. So really it's the same thing except in one
zgtepSTqzgc,Comparison of Learning Rules,35.39,37.67,case we have done the thresholding and in the other case we have
zgtepSTqzgc,Comparison of Learning Rules,37.67,40.24,not done the thresholding. But we end up with two different algorithms
zgtepSTqzgc,Comparison of Learning Rules,40.24,42.410000000000004,with two different behaviors. The perceptron
zgtepSTqzgc,Comparison of Learning Rules,42.41,45.29,"has this nice guarantee. A finite convergence,"
zgtepSTqzgc,Comparison of Learning Rules,45.29,47.81,"which is a really good thing, but that's only in the case where"
zgtepSTqzgc,Comparison of Learning Rules,47.81,49.64,we have linear separability. Whereas the
zgtepSTqzgc,Comparison of Learning Rules,49.64,51.88,"gradient descent rule is good because, calculus."
zgtepSTqzgc,Comparison of Learning Rules,51.88,54.551,>> [LAUGH].
zgtepSTqzgc,Comparison of Learning Rules,54.551,56.78,">> I guess that's not really an answer is it. It's, the"
zgtepSTqzgc,Comparison of Learning Rules,56.78,64.22,gradient descent rule is good because it's more. Robust. To to data sets
zgtepSTqzgc,Comparison of Learning Rules,64.22,68.12,"that are not linearly separable, but it's only going to converge in the limit."
zgtepSTqzgc,Comparison of Learning Rules,70.02,74.24,"To a local optimum. Alright is that, is that the story there Charles?"
zgtepSTqzgc,Comparison of Learning Rules,74.24,75.08,>> As far as I'm concerned.

ymHKayqpp1E,Comparison of Learning Rules Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.47,3.0999999999999996,So why don't we do gradient descent on y hat?
ymHKayqpp1E,Comparison of Learning Rules Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,3.1,5.859999999999999,>> Well there could be many reasons but
ymHKayqpp1E,Comparison of Learning Rules Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,5.86,8.8,the main reason is it's not differentiable. It's
ymHKayqpp1E,Comparison of Learning Rules Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,8.8,11.56,a just discontinuous function. There's no way to
ymHKayqpp1E,Comparison of Learning Rules Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,11.56,13.86,take the derivative at the point where it's discontinuous.

WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,33.29,36.03,"to go to zero, and in fact it does, right. So, as"
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,36.03,38.94,"a goes to negative infinity, the negative a goes to infinity. E"
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,38.94,42.879999999999995,"to the infinity is something really, really big. So it's one over"
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,42.88,46.11,"1 plus something really big, which is like 1 over something huge,"
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,46.11,51.01,"which is almost zero. So, the sigmoid function goes toward, this function"
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,51.01,53.949999999999996,"that we defined here, goes to zero as the activation goes."
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,53.95,58.89,"To negative infinity, that's great, that's just like threshold, and as"
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,58.89,61.59,"the activation gets really really large, we're talking about e to"
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,61.59,64.43,"the minus something really large, which is like e to the"
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,64.43,67.11000000000001,"almost, or like e to the negative infinity which is like"
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,67.11,71.18,"almost zero, so one over one plus zero is essentially one."
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,71.18,73.74000000000001,"So on the one limit, it go towards zero, and the"
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,73.74,76.08999999999999,"other limit it goes towards one, and in fact we can"
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,76.09,78.82000000000001,just Draw this so you can see what it really
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,78.82,83.41,"looks like you know, minus five and below it's essentially at"
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,83.41,86.7,"zero, and then it makes this kind of gradual, you can see"
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,86.7,89.94,"why it's sigmoid s-shaped curve, then it comes back up to"
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,89.94,91.8,the top and it's basically at one by the time it
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,91.8,94.27,get to five. So instead of just an abrupt of transition
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,94.27,97.57,"to zero, we had this gradual transition between negative five and"
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,97.57,101.16,"five. And this is great because it's differentiable, so. What do"
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,101.16,103.25,"you think Charles, does this answer your question?"
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,103.25,104.69,">> It does, I buy that."
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,104.69,107.8,>> Alright good so if we have units
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,107.8,109.42,like this now we can take derivatives which
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,109.42,114.91,means we can use this gradient decent idea all over the place. So not only is
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,114.91,118.28,this function differentiable but the derivative itself has
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,118.28,121.11,a very beautiful form. In particular it turns
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,121.11,123.06,out... That if you take the derivative of
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,123.06,126.45,"this sigma function, it can be written as the"
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,126.45,129.88,function itself times one minus the function itself. So this is
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,129.88,133.10999999999999,"just, this is just really elegant and simple. So, if you have,"
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,133.11,135.65,"you know, the sigma function in your code, there's nothing special that"
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,135.65,138.12,you need for the derivative. You could just compute it this way.
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,138.12,140.98000000000002,"So we would, it's not a bad exercise to go through and"
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,140.98,146.29,"do this. Practice your calculus, we just did this together but it's"
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,146.29,148.98,not that fun to watch. So I would suggest doing it on
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,148.98,152.17999999999998,"your own, and if you have any trouble we'll, we'll provide additional"
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,152.18,154.41,"information for you to, to help you work that out."
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,154.41,157.976,>> But when you do it on your own make sure that no one is watching.
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,157.976,160.62,">> [LAUGH] Well they can watch, they just"
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,160.62,162.48000000000002,"probably won't enjoy it very much. So, so can"
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,162.48,164.2,we say anything about why this form kind
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,164.2,166.47,"of makes sense? So, so what's neat about this"
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,166.47,169.01,"is. As we, as our activation gets very,"
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,169.01,172.95999999999998,"very negative, then our sigma value gets closer and"
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,172.96,174.89000000000001,closer to zero. And if you look at what
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,174.89,177.35,"our derivative is there, it's something like zero times"
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,177.35,180.66,"something like one minus zero, whereas the derivative as"
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,180.66,183.57,"you get to very, very large as, that's like"
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,183.57,187.35,sigma's going to one. And you get 1 times
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,187.35,190.54999999999998,"1 minus 1 minus 1, so essentially 1 times 0."
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,190.55,192.9,So you can see the derivatives flatten out for
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,192.9,196.6,very large and very negative a's. And when a is
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,196.6,199.63,"like, zero, so what happens when a is like"
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,199.63,202.39,"zero? Boy, what does happen when a is like zero?"
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,202.39,205.19,"Charles, what happens if we plug zero into this sigma function?"
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,205.19,206.84,>> You get one half.
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,206.84,209.654,">> Is that obvious? Oh, I see, because e to the minus"
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,209.654,212.939,"a, that's zero, so e to the zero is one, one over one"
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,212.939,215.87,"plus one, so a half. And then our derivative at that point"
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,215.87,219.1,"is a half times a half, or a quarter, so that's kind of neat."
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,219.1,220.535,>> Mm-hm.
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,220.535,222.98,">> So so this is really, this, it's, it's in"
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,222.98,225.45999999999998,a very nice form for being able to work with it.
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,225.46,227.4,>> But it's probably worth saying that.
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,227.4,229.35,Surely you could use other functions that are
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,229.35,231.35999999999999,"different, and there might be good reasons to do"
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,231.36,233.36,that. This one just happens to be a very
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,233.36,236.82000000000002,nice way of dealing with the threshold in question.
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,236.82,240.04,">> Yeah and there's other ways that are also nice. So again,"
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,240.04,244.04,the main properties here are that as activation gets very negative it goes
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,244.04,246.72,"to zero, as activation gets very positive it goes to one, and"
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,246.72,248.39,"there's this smooth transition in between,"
WcDtwxi7Ick,Sigmoid,248.39,250.14,there's other ways of making that shape.
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,0.47,4.529999999999999,Alright so we're now in a great position to talk about what the network part of
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,4.53,6.53,the neural network is about. So now the
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,6.53,9.72,idea is that we can construct using exactly these
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,9.72,14.52,"kind of sigmoid units, a chain of relationships between the input"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,14.52,18.939999999999998,"layer, which are the different components of x, with the output."
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,20.87,25.32,"Y, and the way this is going to happen is, there's u,"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,25.32,27.8,"other layers of, of units in between. That each"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,27.8,31.72,"one is computing the weighted sum, signoided, of the"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,31.72,35.8,layer before it. These other layers of units are
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,35.8,38.059999999999995,"often referred to as hidden layers, because you can kind"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,38.06,39.85,"of see the inputs, you can see the outputs."
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,39.85,42.85,"This, this other stuff is, is less constrained. Or indirectly"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,42.85,45.75,constrained. And what's happening is that each of these
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,45.75,50.18,"units, it's, it's running exactly that kind of, you know,"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,50.18,53.019999999999996,"take the weights, multiply by the things coming into it,"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,53.02,55.09,"put it through the sigmoid and that's your activation, that's your"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,55.09,58.88,"output. So, so what's cool about this is, in the case"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,58.88,62.22,where all these are sigmoid units this mapping from input to
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,62.22,67.25,"output. Is differentiable in terms of the weights, and by saying"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,67.25,70.53,"the whole thing is differentiable, what I'm saying is that we"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,70.53,73.32000000000001,can figure out for any given weight in the network how
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,73.32,75.27,moving it up or down a little bit is going to
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,75.27,77.19,change the mapping from inputs to outputs. So we can
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,77.19,79.6,move all those weights in the direction of producing something more
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,79.6,81.71,like the output that we want. Even though that there's
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,81.71,86.74,"all these sort of crazy non linearities in between. And so,"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,86.74,90.44,"this leads to an idea called back propagation, which is"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,90.44,94.38,"really just at its heart, a computationally beneficial organization of the"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,94.38,97.64,chain rule. We're just computing the derivatives with respect to
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,97.64,100.69,"all the different weights in the network, all in one convenient"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,100.69,105.5,"way, that has, this, this lovely interpretation of having information flowing"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,105.5,108.9,from the inputs to the outputs. And then error information flowing
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,108.9,112.04,"back from the outputs towards the inputs, and that tells you"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,112.04,114.74000000000001,"how to compute all the derivatives. And then, therefore how to make"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,114.74,118.05,"all the weight updates to make, the network produce something more"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,118.05,120.02,like what you wanted it to produce. So this is where
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,120.02,123.33999999999999,"learning is actually taking place, and it's really neat! You know,"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,123.34,125.77000000000001,this back propagation is referring to the fact that the errors are
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,125.77,128.91,flowing backwards. Sometimes it is even called error back propagation.
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,128.91,136.48,">> Nice, so here's a question for you Michael. What happens if I replace"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,136.48,140.88,"the sigmoid units with some other function and, and let's say that function is"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,140.88,143.97,"also different Well, if it's differentiable, then"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,143.97,145.49,"we can still do this, this basic"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,145.49,148.13,kind of trick that says we can
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,148.13,150.9,"compute derivatives, and therefore we can move weights"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,150.9,154.22,around to try to get the network to produce what we want it to produce.
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,154.22,157.27,>> Hmm. That's a big win. Does it still act like a preceptron?
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,157.27,159.25,">> Well, even this doesn't act exactly"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,159.25,161.34,"like a preceptron, right? So it's really just"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,161.34,163.37,"analogous to a preceptron, because we're not really"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,163.37,165.9,"doing the hard thresholding, we don't have guarantees"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,165.9,168.37,"of, of convergence in finite time. In"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,168.37,171.03,"fact, the error function can have many local"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,171.03,176.03,"optima, and what, what we mean by that is this idea that we're trying to get"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,176.03,177.75,"the, we're trying to set the weight so that the error"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,177.75,181.01,"is low, but you can get to these situations where none of"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,181.01,184.06,the weights can really change without making the error worse. And you'd
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,184.06,186.35,"like to think, well good, then we're done, we've made the error"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,186.35,188.09,"as low as we can make it, but in fact it"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,188.09,190.92000000000002,"could actually just be stuck in a local optima, that there's a"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,190.92,193.32,much better way of setting the weights It's just we have to
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,193.32,196.22,change more than just one weight at a time to get there.
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,196.22,197.96,">> Oh so that makes sense, so if we think about"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,197.96,201.45000000000002,sigmoid the sigmoid and the error function that we picked right.
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,201.45,204.79999999999998,"The error function was sum of squared airs,"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,204.8,206.66000000000003,so that looks like a porabola in some
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,206.66,209.31,"high dimensional space, but once we start combining"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,209.31,211.43,"them with others like this over, over, and over"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,211.43,215.86,again Then we have an error space where there may be lots of places that look
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,215.86,217.61,low but only look low if you're standing
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,217.61,220.87,there but globally would not be the lowest point.
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,220.87,223.04,">> Right, exactly right and so you can get these"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,223.04,226.57999999999998,situations in just the one unit version where the error
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,226.58,228.92000000000002,function as you said is this nice little parabola and you can
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,228.92,231.01,move down the gradient and when you get down to the bottom you're
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,231.01,234.2,done. But now when we start throwing these networks of units together we
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,234.2,237.17,can get an error surface that looks just in its cartoon form looks
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,237.17,240.54999999999998,"crazy like this, that there's, it's smooth but there's these Place where"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,240.55,243.43,"it goes down, comes up again and goes down maybe further, comes up"
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,243.43,247.16,again and doesn't come down as far and you could easily get yourself
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,247.16,252.34,stuck at a point like this where you're not at the global minimum.
w9OFiOaTFs8,Neural Network Sketch,252.34,253.63,Your at some local optimum.
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,0.42,1.97,"So one of the things that goes wrong, when you try to"
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,1.97,7.12,actually run gradient descent on a complex network with a lot of data
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,7.12,9.24,is that you can get stuck in these local minima and then
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,9.24,11.58,"you start to wonder, boy is there some other way that I can"
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,11.58,14.01,optimize these weights. I'm trying to find a set of weights for
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,14.01,19.88,"the neural network Well that what? That, that tries to ,minimize error on"
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,19.88,22.49,"the training set. And so, gradient decent is one way to do"
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,22.49,25.72,"it, and it can get stuck, but there's other kinds of advanced optimization"
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,25.72,29.29,"methods that become very appropriate here. And in fact, there's"
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,29.29,32.159,a lot of people in machine learning who think of optimization
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,32.159,34.49,"and learning as kind of being the same thing. That, that"
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,34.49,36.510000000000005,what you're really trying to do in any kind of learning

mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,53.78,56.86,"which basically, where the idea in momentum"
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,56.86,59.25,"is, as we're doing gradient decent, so let's imagine this is our error"
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,59.25,61.95,"surface, we don't want to get stick on this ball here, we want to"
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,61.95,64.42,"kind of pass all the way through it to get to this ball, so maybe"
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,64.42,67.47,"we need to just continue in the direction we've been going. So, instead"
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,67.47,70.12,of You know think of it as a kind of physical analogy. Instead

mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,93.93,97.34,"to get to in a sister course, that can"
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,97.34,100.84,"be applied to, to, to make things more robust."
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,100.84,104.31,"And sometimes it's worth thinking, you know what, we don't really want to just"
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,104.31,107.81,"minimize the error on the training set, we may actually want to have some"
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,107.81,113.21000000000001,"kind of penalty for using, using a structure that's too complex. I mean this,"
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,113.21,116.78999999999999,"this ,uh, when did we, when did we see something like this before Charles?"
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,116.79,120.47000000000001,">> When we were doing regression, and we were talking about over fitting."
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,120.47,123.02,>> So right. That's right. It came up in
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,123.02,125.97999999999999,regression but something similar will also happen in the decision
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,125.98,126.54,tree section.
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,126.54,128.47,">> Sure. We, we had a, we had a issue with"
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,128.47,131.28,"decision trees where if we had, we let the tree grow too"
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,131.28,135.33,"much to explain every little quirk in the data. You'd over fit,"
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,135.33,137.97,"and so ,we came up with a lot of ways of dealing"
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,137.97,143.34,"with that, like pruning. No going too far deeply into the tree."
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,143.34,145.63,You can either do that by filling out the tree and then
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,145.63,148.26999999999998,backing up so you only have a little bit of small error
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,148.27,151.35000000000002,Or by stopping once you've reached some sort of threshold as you
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,151.35,154.41,grow the tree out. That's really the same
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,154.41,156.81,as giving some kind of penalty for complexity.
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,156.81,158.77,">> Yes, exactly, right. So complexity in the"
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,158.77,160.44,tree setting has to do with the size
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,160.44,163.88,"of the tree, in regression it had to do with the order of the polynomial. What"
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,163.88,167.21,"do you suppose it would mean in the neural net setting? And, and how would you"
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,167.21,170.82000000000002,"predict, what negative attributes it might have. So,"
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,170.82,173.54999999999998,"what's, what's a more or less complex network?"
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,173.55,176.47,">> Well, there's two things you can do"
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,176.47,178.02,"with networks, you can add more and more"
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,178.02,181.63000000000002,"nodes, and you can add more and more layers."
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,181.63,183.62,">> Good. So, right. So if we, the more"
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,183.62,185.98000000000002,"nodes that we put into network, the more complicated"
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,185.98,188.64,"the mapping becomes from input to output, the more"
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,188.64,191.17999999999998,"local minima we get, the more we have the ability"
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,191.18,193.91,"to actually model the noise, which brings up exactly"
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,193.91,196.77,the same overfitting issues. It turns out there's another one
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,196.77,198.74,that's actually really interesting in the neural net setting
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,198.74,201.47,"which, I think didn't occur to people In the early"
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,201.47,204.22,"days but it became clear and clear over time,"
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,204.22,207.87,"which is that ,you can also have a complex network,"
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,207.87,211.74,"just because the numbers, the weights, are very large. So"
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,211.74,213.85000000000002,"same number of weights, same number of nodes, same number"
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,213.85,217.60999999999999,"of layers, but larger numbers often leads to more complex."
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,218.61,221.93,"Network and the possibility of overfitting. And so ,sometimes we"
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,221.93,223.68,want to penalize a network not just by giving it
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,223.68,226.75,fewer nodes or layers but also by keeping the numbers
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,226.75,229.51,"in a reasonable range. Does that, does that make sense?"
mE2N3na1VzI,Optimizing Weights,229.51,230.28,>> Makes perfect sense.
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,0.32,4.62,So this brings up the issue of what neural nets
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,4.62,8.42,"are more or less appropriate for. What is the restriction bias,"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,8.42,14.42,"and the inductive bias of this class of classifiers, and"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,14.42,18.8,"regression algorithms? So Charles, can you remind us what restriction bias is?"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,18.8,22.29,">> Well, restriction bias Tells you something"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,22.29,25.45,about the representational power of whatever data structure
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,25.45,29.49,it is that you're using. So in this case the network of neurons.
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,29.49,33.35,And it tells you the set of hypotheses that you're willing to consider.
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,33.35,38.75,">> Right, so if, if the, if there's a great deal of restriction,"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,38.75,41.53,then there's lots and lots of different kinds of models that we're just
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,41.53,44.68,"not even considering. We're, we're restricting our view to just a subset of"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,44.68,49.4,"those. So In the case of neural nets, what restrictions are we putting?"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,49.4,51.15,">> Well,"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,51.15,54.32,"we started out with a simple perceptron unit, and that"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,54.32,59.04,we decided was linear. So we were only considering planes. Then
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,59.04,60.94,"we move to networks, so that we could do things"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,60.94,64.28,"like exor, and that allowed us to do more. Then we"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,64.28,69.45,started sticking Sigmoids and other arbitrary functions and to nodes
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,69.45,72.38000000000001,"so that we could represent more and more, and you mention"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,72.38,74.1,that if you let weights get big and we have
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,74.1,76.69999999999999,"lots of layers and lots of nodes, we can be really,"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,76.7,81.41,"really complex. So, it seems to me that we"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,81.41,83.27,are actually not doing much of a restriction at
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,83.27,87.32,all. So let me ask you this then Michael.
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,87.32,90.25999999999999,"What kind of functions can we represent, clearly we can"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,90.26,93.06,"represent boolean functions, cause we did that. Can we"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,93.06,97.14,"represent continuous functions? That's, that's a great question to"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,97.14,98.47,"ask, that's what we should try to figure that"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,98.47,101.97,"out. So, in the case, as you said, Boolean functions,"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,101.97,105.11,we can. If we give ourselves a complex enough
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,105.11,108.5,"network with enough units, we can basically map all the"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,108.5,111.89,different sub components of any Boolean expression to threshold
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,111.89,114.91,like units and basically build a circuit that can compute
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,114.91,118.0,whatever Boolean function we want. So that one definitely
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,118.0,121.27,can happen. So what about continuous functions? So what is
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,121.27,124.0,it? What is a continuous function? A continuous function
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,124.0,127.51,"is one where, as the input changes the output changes"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,128.52,131.62,"somewhat smoothly, right? There's no jumps in the function like that."
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,131.62,135.38,">> Well, there's no discon, there's no discontinuities, that's for sure."
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,135.38,136.60999999999999,">> Alright, now if we've got a continuous"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,136.61,139.05,function that we're trying to model with a neural
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,139.05,142.5,"network. As long as it's connected, it has"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,142.5,144.97,"no, no discontinuous jumps to any place in the"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,144.97,149.64,"space, we can do this with just a single hidden layer. As long as we have enough"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,149.64,151.39999999999998,"hidden units, as long as there's enough units in"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,151.4,153.65,"that layer. And, essentially one way to think about"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,153.65,157.53,"that is, if we have enough hidden units, each hidden"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,157.53,159.98,unit can worry about one little patch of the function
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,159.98,165.07,"that, that it needs to model. And they, the patches"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,165.07,167.38,get set at the hidden. And at the output layer
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,167.38,169.41,they get stitched together. And if you just have that
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,169.41,171.69,one layer you can make any function as long as
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,171.69,175.71,it's continuous. If it's Arbitrary. We can still represent that
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,175.71,178.72,in our neural network. Any mapping from inputs to outputs we
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,178.72,181.91,"can represent, even if it's discontinuous, just by adding"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,181.91,184.97,"one more hidden layer, so two total hidden layers."
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,184.97,186.96,And that gives us the ability to not just
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,186.96,190.24,"stitch these patches at their seams, but also to have"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,190.24,193.34,"big jumps between the patches. So in fact, neural"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,193.34,196.17000000000002,networks are not very restrictive in terms of their bias
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,196.17,200.1,as long as you have a sufficiently complex network
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,200.1,203.6,"structure, right, so maybe multiple hidden layers and multiple units."
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,203.6,203.91,>> So
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,203.91,206.68,"that worries me a little bit Michael, because it means that we're almost"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,206.68,208.72,"certainly going to overfit, right? We're"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,208.72,211.14,going to have arbitrarily complicated neural networks and
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,211.14,214.79999999999998,we can represent anything we want to. Including all of the noise that's
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,214.8,218.21,"represented in our training set. So, how are we going to avoid doing that?"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,218.21,221.03,">> Excellent question. So, it seems like there's, there"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,221.03,224.13,"is exactly that worry. But, it is the case"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,224.13,226.2,"though, that when we train neural networks, we typically"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,226.2,229.39999999999998,give them some bounded number of hidden units and
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,229.4,232.52,"we give them some bounded number of layers. And so, it's"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,232.52,236.18,not like any fixed network can actually capture any arbitrary function. So
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,236.18,238.70000000000002,"any fixed network can only capture whatever it can capture, which"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,238.7,242.32,is a smaller set. So going to neural nets in general doesn't
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,242.32,245.73,have much restriction. but any given network architecture actually does have
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,245.73,248.54,"a bit more restriction. So that's one thing, the other is hey,"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,248.54,251.51,well we can do with overfitting what we've done the other
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,251.51,254.60999999999999,times we've had to deal with overfitting. And that's to use ideas
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,254.61,259.14,"like, cross validation. And we used cross validation to"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,259.14,262.71999999999997,decide. How many hidden layers to use. We can
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,262.72,267.79,use it to decide how many nodes to put in each layer. And we can also use it
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,267.79,270.82,to decide when to stop training because the weights
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,270.82,273.4,"have gotten too large. So, and this is, it's"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,273.4,275.21,probably worth pointing this out that this is kind
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,275.21,279.96999999999997,"of a different, different property from the. Other classes"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,279.97,282.70000000000005,of supervised learning algorithms we've looked at so far. So
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,282.7,284.97999999999996,"in a decision tree, you build up the decision tree, an"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,284.98,290.14000000000004,"you may have over fit, but it is what it is."
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,290.14,292.72999999999996,"In regression, you know, you solve the regression problem, and again"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,292.73,295.90000000000003,that may have over fit. What's interesting about neural network training
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,295.9,298.72999999999996,"is it's this iterative process that you started out running, and"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,298.73,301.98,"as it's running, it's actually Errors going down and down and"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,301.98,305.65000000000003,"down. So, in this standard kind of graph, we get the"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,305.65,309.21999999999997,error on the training set dropping as we increase iterations. It's
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,309.22,312.13000000000005,doing a better and better job of modeling the training data.
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,312.13,315.25,"But, in classic style, if you look at the error in"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,315.25,318.29,"the, in some kind of held-out test set, or maybe in a"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,318.29,321.26000000000005,"cross validation set, you see the error starting out kind of"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,321.26,324.43,"high and maybe dropping along with this, and at some point"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,324.43,327.72,"It actually turns around and goes the other way. So here,"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,327.72,328.99,even though we're not changing the
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,328.99,330.91,"network structure itself, we're just continuing"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,330.91,334.56,"to improve our fit, we actually get this, this pattern that"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,334.56,338.95,"we've seen before, that the cross validation error can turn around and,"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,338.95,341.27,"and at this, you know, at this low point, you might have,"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,341.27,343.78,you might want to just stop training your network there. The more
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,343.78,347.85999999999996,"you train it, possibly the worse you'll do. And again, that, it's"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,347.86,350.57,reflecting this idea that the complexity of the network is not just
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,350.57,353.28,"in the nodes and the layers, but also in the magnetude of"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,353.28,356.03999999999996,the weights. Typically what happens in this turnaround point is that some
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,356.04,357.91,weights are actually getting larger and larger
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,357.91,360.92,"and larger. So, just wanted to highlight that"
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,360.92,363.32,difference between neural net function approximation of what
UQk_bq2exSM,Restriction Bias,363.32,364.76,we see in some of the other algorithms
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,0.315,1.94,"Alright, you know the issue that we want to make sure"
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,1.94,4.609999999999999,that we think about each time we introduce a new kind
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,4.61,8.9,of supervised learning representation is to ask what its preference bias
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,8.9,11.33,"is. So Charles, can you remind us what preference bias is?"
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,11.33,14.41,>> Mike researcher bias tells you what it is you
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,14.41,17.43,are able to represent. Preference bias tells you something about the
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,17.43,20.75,"algorithm that you are using to learn. That tells you,"
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,20.75,26.27,"given two representations, why I would prefer one over the other."
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,26.27,28.29,"So, perhaps you think back what we talked"
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,28.29,34.56,"about with decision trees, we preferred trees where nodes"
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,34.56,37.36,near the top had high information gain We preferred
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,37.36,40.519999999999996,correct trees. We preferred trees that were shorter to
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,40.52,43.24,ones that were longer unnecessarily and so on and
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,43.24,45.61,so forth. So that actually brings up a point
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,45.61,47.89,"here which is, we haven't actually chosen an algorithm."
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,47.89,51.57,"We talked about how derivatives work, how back propagation"
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,51.57,56.47,"works, but you missed telling me one very important thing, which is how do"
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,56.47,59.42,"we start? You tell me how to update the weights but, how do I"
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,59.42,61.45,start out with the weights? Do they all start at zero? Do they all
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,61.45,64.26,start out at one? How do you usually set the weights in the beginning?
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,64.26,67.53,">> Yes indeed. We did not talk about that, that's, it's"
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,67.53,70.42,really important. You can't run this algorithm without initializing the weights
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,70.42,73.09,to something. Right? We did talk about how you update the
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,73.09,76.97,"weights but they don't just you know, just start undefined and you,"
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,76.97,78.85,you can't just update something that's undefined. So we
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,78.85,81.66,have to set the initial weights to something. So pretty
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,81.66,87.3,"typical thing for people to do, is small, random,"
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,87.3,91.41,values. So why do you suppose we want random values?
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,91.41,94.64999999999999,>> Because we have no particular reason to pick one set of values over
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,94.65,96.04,another. So you start somewhere in the
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,96.04,98.83000000000001,space. Probably helps us to avoid local minimum.
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,98.83,102.82,>> Yea kind of. I mean there's also the issue of Well
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,102.82,106.69999999999999,"if we run the algorithm multiple times if we get stuck, we like"
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,106.7,109.9,"it not to get stuck exactly there again, if do, if you run it"
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,109.9,113.69000000000001,"again. So it gives some variability, which is a helpful thing in avoiding"
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,113.69,115.49,"local minimal. And what do you suppose,"
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,115.49,117.25,it's important to start with small values.
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,117.25,122.84,>> Well you just said. In our discussion before that if the weights get
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,122.84,124.99000000000001,really big that can sometimes lead to
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,124.99,128.75799999999998,"over fitting, because it let's you represent arbitrarily"
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,128.758,129.47,complex functions.
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,129.47,131.29,">> Good. And so, and what is that"
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,131.29,133.16,tell us about what the preference bias is then?
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,133.16,137.57999999999998,>> Well if we start out with small random values. That means
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,137.58,142.54000000000002,we are starting out with low complexity. So that means we prefer Simpler
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,142.54,147.17999999999998,explanations to more complex explanations. And of course the usual stuff like
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,147.18,149.98000000000002,"we prefer, correct answers to incorrect answers, and so on and so forth."
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,149.98,153.92,">> > So, you'd say that neural-nets implement, or maybe we should"
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,153.92,160.32999999999998,"say, that neural networks implement a kind of bias that says Prefer correct over"
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,160.33,164.08,"incorrect but all things being equal, the simpler explanation, is preferred."
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,164.08,166.36,">> Well, if you have the right algorithm. If the algorithm starts"
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,166.36,169.94000000000003,"with small, random values and tries to stop, you know, when you"
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,169.94,174.16,"start over-fitting Then you, cause you're going to start out with the simpler"
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,174.16,177.62,"explanations first before you allow your weights to grow. so you, about that."
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,177.62,179.28,>> So this
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,179.28,182.24,reminiscent of the principal that is known as Occan's
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,182.24,185.24,razor which is often stated as entities should not be
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,185.24,188.94,multiplied unnecessarily. And given that we're working with neural
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,188.94,194.23,"networks, there's a lot of unnecessary multiplication that happens. [LAUGH]"
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,194.23,198.48999999999998,"But, in fact, this actually is referring to exactly what we've been"
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,198.49,201.42000000000002,"talking about. So this unnecessarily is,"
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,201.42,204.23,"one interpretation of this is that, ""Well,"
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,204.23,206.84,"when is it necessary?"" It's necessary if you're getting better"
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,206.84,210.87,"explanatory power, you're fitting your data better. So Unnecessarily would"
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,210.87,212.68,"mean, well we're not doing any better at fitting the"
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,212.68,215.61,"data. If we're not doing any better at fitting the data,"
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,215.61,221.01000000000002,then we should not multiply entities. And multiply here means
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,221.01,224.34,make more complex. So don't make something more complex unless
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,224.34,226.70000000000002,"you're getting better error, or if two things have similar"
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,226.7,230.07,"error Choose the simpler one, use the one that's less complex."
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,230.07,234.48,"That has been shown to, if you mathematize this and you use it in"
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,234.48,237.23999999999998,"the context of supervised learning, that we're"
mzkIMfatv4M,Preference Bias,237.24,241.64000000000001,going to get better generalization error with simpler hypotheses.
kftOCMFpQNg,Summary,0.26,1.8800000000000001,So that brings us to the end of the
kftOCMFpQNg,Summary,1.88,3.59,topics we are going to talk about in terms of
kftOCMFpQNg,Summary,3.59,5.29,neural nets. There's going to be some interesting stuff
kftOCMFpQNg,Summary,5.29,8.129999999999999,for you to do in terms of the homework where
kftOCMFpQNg,Summary,8.13,10.21,you'll be exposed to some other important concepts. But
kftOCMFpQNg,Summary,10.21,12.59,"that's, that's all we're going to lecture about for now."
kftOCMFpQNg,Summary,12.59,17.3,So let's just remind ourselves what exactly we covered in
kftOCMFpQNg,Summary,17.3,20.02,the neural net section. So Charles what do you remember?
kftOCMFpQNg,Summary,21.11,25.02,>> I remember perceptrons. I remember.
kftOCMFpQNg,Summary,25.02,25.83,>> And
kftOCMFpQNg,Summary,25.83,28.959999999999997,"perceptron was a threshold unit, a linear threshold"
kftOCMFpQNg,Summary,28.96,31.310000000000002,"unit, and we could put networks of them together."
kftOCMFpQNg,Summary,31.31,31.97,>> Yes.
kftOCMFpQNg,Summary,31.97,36.519999999999996,>> To produce any Boolean function. What else?
kftOCMFpQNg,Summary,36.52,38.970000000000006,"Oh, we had a learning rule for perceptrons."
kftOCMFpQNg,Summary,38.97,43.83,>> Mm-hm. Which runs in finite time for linearly separable data sets.
kftOCMFpQNg,Summary,43.83,47.43,>> And we learned a general differentiable rule. Adding
kftOCMFpQNg,Summary,47.43,50.36,general we learned about propagation using a gradient set.
kftOCMFpQNg,Summary,50.36,51.46,>> And
kftOCMFpQNg,Summary,51.46,54.480000000000004,"we talked a little bit about the, about the preference"
kftOCMFpQNg,Summary,54.48,58.419999999999995,"and restriction by c's of neural networks. Alright, til next time."
kftOCMFpQNg,Summary,58.42,59.18,>> See you Michael.

ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.93,2.48,>> Hey Charles! How's it going?
ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,2.48,4.51,>> It's going pretty well. How's it going with you?
ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,4.51,7.949999999999999,>> It is a beautiful fall day here in Providence Rhode Island.

ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,18.07,21.05,"talk about a different class of ,uh, learning"
ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,21.05,23.11,algorithms and approaches than we've been talking about before.
ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,23.11,25.36,">> So now the other ones were low class, this is going to"
ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,25.36,26.0,be high class?
ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,26.0,29.71,>> Exactly. And we call them instance based learning. Which
ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,29.71,32.52,sounds very hoity toity and high voluting. Don't you agree?
ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,32.52,33.49,">> Yeah, sure, why not?"
ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,33.49,33.632000000000005,>> [LAUGH]
ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,33.632,35.629999999999995,>> It sounds like it maybe has good posture.
ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,35.63,37.400000000000006,">> It does, in fact, have good posture."
ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,37.4,40.239999999999995,">> Well let's, let's learn about it. I'm, I'm, I'm intrigued."
ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,40.24,42.2,">> Yeah, so I think that ,uh, what we're going to"
ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,42.2,44.09,"end up talking about to day is kind of interesting, I"
ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,44.09,47.52,"hope. But it's sort of different, and what I'm hoping is"
ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,47.52,50.43000000000001,"through this discussion Is that, we will be able to reveal"
ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,50.43,54.67,"some of the unspoken assumptions that we've been making so far, okay?"
ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,54.67,57.78,">> Unspoken assumptions, it sounds, yeah, okay, that sounds"
ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,57.78,59.33,like we should get to the bottom of that.
ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,59.33,62.41,">> Yes, so let's do that. So, just to remind you of what we have"
ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,62.41,66.77,"been doing in the ,um, past, this is what was going on with all of"
ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,66.77,68.25,"our little supervised learning tasks, right. We"
ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,68.25,70.07,"were given a bunch of training data ,labeled"
ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,70.07,75.61,"here as you know, x, y One, xy two, xy three, dot, dot, dot, xy zen."
ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,75.61,79.15,"And ,uh, we would then learn some function."
ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,79.15,81.13000000000001,"So, for example, if we have a bunch of"
ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,81.13,82.52,"points in a plane, we might learn a"
ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,82.52,84.97,"line to represent them, which is what this little"
ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,84.97,88.83,blue line is. And what was happening here is we take all this data. We come up
ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,88.83,91.17999999999999,with some function that represents the data. And
ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,91.18,93.82000000000001,"then we would throw the data away effectively, right?"
ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,93.82,96.77,">> Okay. Yeah, so like, black is the input here and then"
ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,96.77,99.97999999999999,the two blue things are what get derived by the learning algorithm.
ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,99.98,100.63000000000001,>> Right. And then in
ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,100.63,102.74,"the future when we get some data point, let's"
ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,102.74,104.55,"call it x, we would pass it through this function"
ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,104.55,107.41,"whatever it is. In this case, probably line. And"
ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,107.41,110.94,"that would, be how we would determine answers going forward."
ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,110.94,112.87,">> Yeah. That's, that's what we've been talking about."
ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,112.87,114.4,>> Right. And in particular without reference
ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,114.4,116.60000000000001,to the original data. So. I want
ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,116.6,122.05,to propose an alternative and the alternative is basically going to not do this.
ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,122.05,122.354,>> [LAUGH]
ZTjot416e-g,Instance Based Learning Before - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,122.354,124.889,">> So let me give you a, let me, let me tell u exactly what I mean by that."
yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.2,4.11,"Okay, so here what I mean concretely by not doing this thing"
yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,4.11,6.98,over here any more. So here what I'm proposing we do now. We
yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,6.98,9.17,"take all the data, all of the training data we had, the"
yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,9.17,14.04,"xy1, xy2, dot, dot, dot, xyn and we put it in a database"
yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,14.04,16.027,>> Ah-ha.
yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,16.027,19.39,>> And then next time we get some new x to look
yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,19.39,22.630000000000003,"at, we just look it up in the database. And we're done."
yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,22.63,25.98,">> None of this fancy shmancy learning, none of this"
yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,25.98,32.13,"producing an appropriate function like you know, wx+b, or what ever"
yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,32.13,34.74,the equation of a line is. None of that fancy stuff anymore.
yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,34.74,36.980000000000004,We just stick in to the data base. People written data
yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,36.98,39.41,base programs before. We'll look it up when we're done. We're done.Period
yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,39.41,42.31999999999999,>> I feel like you've changed the paradigm.
yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,42.32,44.54,">> Yes, I am a paradigm changer. So what do you think?"
yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,44.54,47.79,">> It's like, it's like disruptive. It's going to throw off the markets."
yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,47.79,50.94,">> Yeah. It's going to change everything. So, what do you think?"
yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,51.94,53.26,">> well, I mean, so there's a bunch of"
yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,53.26,55.489999999999995,really cool things about this idea. Which is why
yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,55.49,58.2,"I'm excited. So one is it, you know, it"
yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,58.2,61.040000000000006,"doesn't forget, right? So it actually is very reliable."
yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,61.04,65.12,"It's very ,um ,dependable, right, so if you put in an x, y pair you ask for the"

yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,70.18,72.93,">> Right, so we don't, yeah that's a good point. So we look at this little"
yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,72.93,74.60000000000001,"blue line over here, you'll notice that say,"

yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,76.96,80.88,"get back what we put in, so, it remembers, it's like an elephant. Good."
yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,80.88,83.86,>> So that's kind of cool. Another thing is that
yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,83.86,88.74,"there's none of this wasted time, you know, doing learning [LAUGH]."
yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,88.74,90.89,"It just takes the data and it, and it's, very"
yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,90.89,93.497,rapidly just puts it in the database. So [CROSSTALK] it's fast.
yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,93.497,96.06,>> It's fast. It's like. I like it when you say nice things
yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,96.06,99.9,"about my algorithms. Okay. So it's fast. Anything else, you can think of?"
yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,99.9,102.19000000000001,">> Sh, yeah I cant think of"
yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,102.19,103.48,one more thing at least.
yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,103.48,104.075,>> Mm-hm.
yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,104.075,106.89,">> Which is ,that like you, it's simple."
yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,106.89,109.99,>> [LAUGH] That's true. I am simple. I am simple and
yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,109.99,113.17999999999999,straightforward. I just need a few things to make me happy.
yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,113.18,113.99000000000001,>> Bacon.
yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,113.99,114.67999999999999,">> Bacon, and"
yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,114.68,115.55000000000001,>> And

yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,145.02,148.59,fast. And it's very simple. There's really no interesting learning
yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,148.59,150.44,going on here. So it's the perfect algorithm when we're done.

yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,208.53,211.42,a couple of examples that are all the same. I have got

yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,220.28,222.59,"that you have described so far, wouldn't commit to either"

yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,233.3,236.22,of fixing it. I think There's sort of a basic problem

yZBKzXjSg1k,Instance Based Learning Now - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,241.64,244.11999999999998,"looking up a little too literally, right? So I stick in"

0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,39.36,42.089999999999996,suggests that red is not a bad choice here.
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,42.09,43.11000000000001,>> Mm
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,43.11,44.83,>> It's in a reddish part of town.
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,44.83,47.4,">> Yeah, I get that. So, so you think it's a"
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,47.4,51.82,"pretty, fair thing to bet that this should be red then?"
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,51.82,55.22,>> Yeah I mean I think that if you were really asking me seriously
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,55.22,58.98,I would wonder about that blue point to the right of the highway and whether
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,58.98,60.62,that had any influence.
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,60.62,62.32,>> That's pretty far away.
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,62.32,63.71,">> Yeah, it's not that far away."
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,63.71,65.47,">> Well in Atlanta, once you cross highways"
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,65.47,67.07,you might as well be an infinite distance away.
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,67.07,70.36,">> Well so, okay, but. That's a good point then."
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,70.36,73.61,"So, I guess I was interpreting your notion of distance as"
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,73.61,76.83,"being, you know, like straight line distance on the map. But"
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,76.83,79.51,maybe that doesn't make sense for this kind of neighborhood example.
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,79.51,81.66000000000001,">> Hm, no, that's a good point. So,"
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,81.66,84.6,we've been talking about distance sort of implicitly.
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,84.6,89.785,But this notion of distance. It's actually quite important. So maybe distance is
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,89.785,91.82,"straight-line distance, maybe it's as the crow"
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,91.82,94.46,flies. Maybe it's driving distance. Maybe it
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,94.46,97.17999999999999,"has to take into account the fact that, when you cross highways in"
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,97.18,99.08000000000001,"Atlanta, you're typically moving into a completely"
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,99.08,101.39,different universe. These sorts of things matter.
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,101.39,105.17,">> Yeah. So I could imagine I don't know, like Google Maps distance."
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,105.17,107.82000000000001,>> Right. Or how many paths can you get there
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,107.82,109.72999999999999,and which is the shortest one given the traffic? There's all
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,109.73,111.9,kinds of things like that you could do. So. So that's
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,111.9,114.41000000000001,"fair, that's fair. But that just says that this, this distant, we"
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,114.41,116.32,have to be very careful what we mean by distance and
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,116.32,119.6,that's okay. But let's just say for the sake of this discussion
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,119.6,123.41,that these are the closest points by some reasonable measure of
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,123.41,126.86,"distance. So, in that world, would you be happy if you had"
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,126.86,130.6,"to pick a single example? a single output, a single label"
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,130.6,134.34,"of red ,uh, blue or green. Would you be happy picking red?"
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,134.34,135.36,">> Yeah, I"
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,135.36,137.22000000000003,"mean you know, not ecstatic, but okay."
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,137.22,139.91,">> That's fair. So, I like this. So, we, we"
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,139.91,144.46,went from just picking our nearest neighbor to picking our nearest
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,144.46,147.22,"neighbors. And ,what's a good value you think we should,"
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,147.22,149.59,we should stick to with neighbors? We started with one and
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,149.59,152.41,"that clearly wasn't good. You picked, at least not in"
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,152.41,156.37,all cases and you came up with five. So what do
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,156.37,159.15,"you think? What, what, if I'm going to call this algorithm something,"
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,159.15,160.55,what do you think five nearest neighbors? What do you think?
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,160.55,161.05,What should I call it?
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,161.05,164.57000000000002,">> Five seems good. I mean I feel like that, that's gotta be universal."
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,164.57,165.66,>> The number five?
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,165.66,166.19,>> Yeah.
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,166.19,168.43,>> Well it is in Atlanta but it might
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,168.43,170.29000000000002,not be univeral in wherever it is you are.
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,170.29,172.76,>> We'll call it the Georgia Tech nearest neighbors.
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,172.76,176.32999999999998,>> That doesn't seem like an algorithm that's going to to be used very much.
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,176.33,179.73000000000002,">> Fair enough. All right. So what about,"
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,179.73,181.59,we could do as many nearest neighbors as
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,181.59,185.57,is appropriate. Or maybe we should just make it a free parameter and call it K.
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,185.57,187.38,">> Ok, I like that. K nearest neighbors, so we'll have K"
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,187.38,189.32,"nearest neighbors. And we'll pick our K numbers. Oh, and you said"
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,189.32,191.88,"something fancy there, by the way. You said free parameter. I like"
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,191.88,193.88,"that. We should, we should come back to that again. So we"
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,193.88,197.89,"have an algorithm, k nearest neighbors. Which takes K nearest neighbors as"
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,197.89,201.92999999999998,a way of deciding how you're going to label some query point here.
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,201.93,206.24,And we've identified two parameters to the algorithm so far. K Which
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,206.24,209.81,is the number of neighbors we're going to use. And some notion of distance.
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,209.81,210.31,">> Oh, sure."
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,210.31,210.61,>> Which
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,210.61,212.77,"here we were kind of using in the sort of obvious way,"
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,212.77,215.53,but there might be other ways we might want to use distance here.
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,215.53,218.03,">> Yeah, like I could imagine if the houses, if,"
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,218.03,222.5,had additional features like how many Square footages they had.
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,222.5,224.51,">> Right, stuff like that. That would make perfect sense."
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,224.51,227.72,"So, so really distance, we're using distance here in a kind"
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,227.72,230.52,"of in an over loaded sense, because this is something"
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,230.52,234.10000000000002,on a map. But really distance is a standard for similarity.
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,234.1,235.94,">> Similarity, good. It's kind of standard"
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,235.94,237.21,for the opposite of similarity.
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,237.21,240.21,">> [LAUGH] Well distance is just a kind of similarity, right?"
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,240.21,243.76000000000002,"But in case of, you know, points on the map. Similarity,"
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,243.76,245.92999999999998,it sort of makes sense because as you said when we
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,245.93,247.27,"were talking about real estate, location,"
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,247.27,250.66,"location, location matters. So, there, similarity"
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,250.66,253.76,really is kind of the inverse of distance. But in other
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,253.76,256.649,"ways, things like the number of veterans you have, whether you're"
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,256.649,258.1,"one on side of the highway or the other, the school"
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,258.1,261.089,"district you're in, things like that, are other things you might add"
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,261.089,264.94,as features or dimensions when you talk about similarity or distance.
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,264.94,266.87,"Okay, so I like this. I think we have a general algorithm"
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,266.87,269.58,now and I think it does a pretty good job of
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,269.58,273.2,addressing the points you brought up. We no longer have to worry
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,273.2,276.49,"about overfitting as much, at least it seems that way to"
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,276.49,278.88,me. And we have a way of being a little bit more
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,278.88,282.83,"robust to this, you know, not having an exact data point"
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,282.83,285.83,"in the database. So ,maybe we should turn this into an algorithm."
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,285.83,286.60999999999996,">> Yeah,"
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,286.61,287.25,let's go for it.
0WELNkvAQz0,Cost of the House Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,287.25,287.98,">> Okay, let's do that."
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.24,4.09,"Okay, so what we have here, again, is pseudocode for"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,4.09,6.699999999999999,our K-NN algorithm. And I'm sort of writing it as
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,6.7,9.15,"like, a function. So, you're going to be given some"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,9.15,12.56,"training data D, that's the little x, y points, x"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,12.56,14.110000000000001,"y one, x y 2, x y 3, so on"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,14.11,17.53,and so fourth. You're given some kind of distance metric
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,17.53,22.46,or similarity function. And this is important because this represents
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,22.46,25.450000000000003,"the domain knowledge as I think we, we've already said."
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,25.45,28.64,"You get some number of neighbors that you care about,"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,28.64,31.14,"k, hence the k and n, which also, by the"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,31.14,34.62,"way, represents domain knowledge. Tells you something about how many"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,34.62,36.3,neighbors you think you should have. And then are given
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,36.3,39.23,some particular new query point and I want to output
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,39.23,42.97,"some kind of answer, some label, some value. So the"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,42.97,46.589999999999996,K nn algorithm is remarkably simple given these things you
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,46.59,50.480000000000004,simply find a set of nearest neighbors such that they
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,50.48,53.83,are the K closest to your query point.
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,53.83,57.949999999999996,">> Okay. I'm sort of processing this. So the, the data"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,57.95,61.61,the capital D. Are those pairs and there's a set of pairs?
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,61.61,62.15,>> Yes.
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,62.15,68.65,>> Ok. And k smallest distances. So this NN this is a set?
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,68.65,69.15,>> Yes.
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,69.15,71.97,>> And it consists of all the elements in
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,71.97,75.91,the data that are closest to the query point?
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,75.91,79.13,>> Yep. And the so the query point is a parameter of that. Okay.
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,79.13,82.17999999999999,"Yeah. Alright. I think I. Oh. And then it's, then the so it's just return."
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,82.18,83.60000000000001,">> Yeah, so we haven't figured out what"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,83.6,85.08999999999999,to return. So there's two separate cases we've been
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,85.09,87.69,"talking about so far. One is where, we're doing"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,87.69,91.5,"classification, and one is where we're doing regression. So,"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,91.5,93.36,"a question for you would be, what do you"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,93.36,95.94,"think we should when we're doing classification? Sort of,"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,95.94,97.98,what we were doing before on the map. What
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,97.98,99.62,will be a way of returning a proper label?
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,99.62,100.92,>> So you want to
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,100.92,103.52,"label, not a, like a weight on a label or something like that?"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,103.52,104.58,>> No. I want a label. You have to
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,104.58,106.42,produce an answer. You have to commit to something Michael.
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,106.42,109.9,>> Alright. Can I commit to more than one thing?
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,109.9,110.4,>> Nope.
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,111.72,115.46,>> Okay. So I would say that a reasonable thing to do
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,115.46,119.47999999999999,there would be. Did we get Ys associated with the things in NN?
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,119.48,120.02000000000001,>> Yeap.
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,120.02,122.58999999999999,>> So I would go with they should vote.
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,123.8,125.89999999999999,">> I like that. I think that's a good one,"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,125.9,128.22,so we'll simply vote and what does it mean to vote?
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,128.22,133.54,">> It means, let's see, so feel like there would be a way to represent"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,133.54,136.69,"it in terms of NN, the set. Like do you want me to write it formally?"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,136.69,137.32,>> No.
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,137.32,141.82,">> Oh, then I would just say The closest point."
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,141.82,145.37,Whichever yi is most frequent among the closest points wins.
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,145.37,147.87,">> Yeah. Right. So you want to find a,"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,147.87,151.52,"a vote of basically a vote of the yi's,"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,151.52,155.13000000000002,that are apart of the neighborhood set. And you take the plurality.
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,155.13,159.16,>> Plurality I see. So it's whichever one occurs the most.
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,159.16,159.82999999999998,>> Right.
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,159.83,160.96,>> What if there's ties?
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,160.96,162.87,>> It's the mode. The mode. Right.
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,162.87,162.96,>> Right.
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,162.96,165.52,>> Mmmm. I love mode.
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,165.52,168.44,">> What if they're ties? That's a good point. Well, if they are"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,168.44,171.44,"ties among the output, then you're just going to have to pick one."
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,171.44,171.57,>> OK.
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,171.57,173.2,>> And there's lots of ways you might do that.
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,173.2,177.38,"You might say, well, I'll take the one. That is"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,177.38,180.35999999999999,"say, most commonly represented in the data"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,180.36,183.28,period. Or I'll just randomly pick each
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,183.28,186.13,"time, or any number of ways you might, you c an imagine doing that."
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,186.13,187.79,>> The one that's first alphabetically.
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,187.79,189.2,>> The one that's first lexicographically?
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,189.2,190.07999999999998,>> Hm.
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,190.08,191.89000000000001,>> What about in the regression case?
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,191.89,195.28799999999998,>> Okay. So in the regression case our y-is are numbers.
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,195.288,199.61,">> Uh-huh. And we have the closest Yi's, so"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,199.61,202.79000000000002,we have a bunch of those numbers and it
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,202.79,205.32999999999998,seems like [LAUGH] if you have a pile of numbers and have to return
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,205.33,208.41000000000003,"one, a standard thing to do would be to take the average, or the mean."
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,208.41,211.91,>> Yeah. Now let's just simply take the mean
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,211.91,213.98,"of the Yi's, and at least there, you don't"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,213.98,217.25,"have to worry about a tie. That's right. Though,"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,217.25,218.85,"I guess, you know. We didn't really deal with"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,218.85,220.85999999999999,the question of what happens if there's more than
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,220.86,222.71,"k small. It's, like, what if they're all exactly"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,222.71,224.6,the same distance? All n of them are exactly
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,224.6,226.78,the same distance. So which are the k closest?
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,226.78,227.81,">> Well, there's lots"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,227.81,230.95,"of things you could do there. I guess what I would suggest doing, is,"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,230.95,234.79999999999998,"take the, If you have more than k that are close, that are closest"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,234.8,237.99,"because you have a bunch of ties, in terms of the distance. Just take"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,237.99,241.93,all of them. Get the smallest number greater than or equal to k. Okay.
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,241.93,243.17000000000002,>> That seem reasonable?
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,243.17,246.23999999999998,">> Yeah, I think that's what college rankings do."
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,246.24,250.41,">> Actually, that is what college rankings do, and then they, yeah,"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,250.41,252.88,"that's exactly what college rankings do. So, let's do that. We know"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,252.88,256.07,"that college rankings make sense. [LAUGH]. Yeah,"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,256.07,259.11,"those are, they're scientifically proven to be,"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,259.11,259.529,>> Youths.
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,259.529,261.76,">> scary, scary to people in colleges."
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,261.76,263.38,">> That's exactly right. So, here's what we've"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,263.38,264.95,"got, Michael. So, all we do is we take"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,264.95,266.49,the training data. We have some notion of
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,266.49,268.35,similarity or distance. We have a notion of the
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,268.35,270.25,number of neighbors that we care about. We
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,270.25,272.88,"have a query point, we find the K closest"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,272.88,275.46999999999997,"to one, you know breaking ties accordingly. And then"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,275.47,277.91,"we basically average in some way, in a way"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,277.91,279.52000000000004,"that make sense for classification, in a way they make sense"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,279.52,282.72999999999996,"for regression and we are done. It's a very simple algorithm,"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,282.73,285.92,but some of that's because a lot of decisions are being
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,285.92,290.1,"left up to the designer. The distance metric. The number k,"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,290.1,293.67,how you're going to break ties. Exactly how you choose to implement
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,293.67,297.89000000000004,voting. Exactly how you choose to implement the mean or the
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,297.89,300.49,average operation that shows how to do here. And you could
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,300.49,303.3,"put a bunch of different things here and you end up in,"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,304.5,307.86,"completely, you could end up with completely different answer. Mm."
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,307.86,310.11,">> By the way, one thing that you might do, just to give"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,310.11,313.75,"you an example of just, how much range there is here. Is rather than"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,313.75,317.25,"doing a simple vote by counting, you could do a vote that is say,"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,317.25,322.19,weighted by how far away you are. So we could have a weighted vote.
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,322.19,323.23,>> Uh-huh.
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,323.23,324.38,>> That might help us with ties.
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,324.38,326.4,>> That could help with ties. Yeah.
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,326.4,329.35999999999996,">> You could do a weighted average. Yes, right."
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,329.36,334.58000000000004,"So, you're basically saying that the y values that correspond to x values that"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,334.58,338.24,are closer to the query point have more of an influence on the mean.
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,338.24,339.58,">> Which makes some sense, right?"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,339.58,341.45,">> No, I think it makes a lot of sense!"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,341.45,344.31,">> So, how would you weight that? What would you do?"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,344.31,346.61,>> I would weight it by the similarity.
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,346.61,350.17,">> Right, so well in this case, the similarity is we have a distance value"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,350.17,354.88,"similarity, so You would have to, you know, weight it by something like one over"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,354.88,355.46,the distance.
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,355.46,359.4,>> Oh I see. Okay. That seems like a hack.
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,359.4,361.88,>> Sure but it's a hack that sort of makes sense.
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,361.88,362.99,>> Okay.
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,362.99,365.28000000000003,>> Okay. So anyway. Simple algorithim. Lots
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,365.28,367.28,and lots of decisions to make here. All
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,367.28,371.60999999999996,"of which could in principle have a pretty big effect. And so, in order to see"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,371.61,376.15000000000003,"that, I want to do two quizzes that I hope get to heart of this and"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,376.15,377.52,maybe give us a little bit of insight
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,377.52,380.37,into how some of these decisions might matter
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,380.37,384.31,"on the one hand, and exactly just how simple"
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,384.31,386.77,or not simple this algorithm turns out to be. Okay?
mpU84OJ5vdQ,K NN - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,386.77,387.16999999999996,>> Awesome.
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.38,2.02,"Okay Michael, I have two quizzes for you. Okay?"
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,2.02,2.76,">> Yeah, yeah."
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,2.76,6.71,">> Here's the first quiz, and here's the way it's set up."

xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,13.6,16.239,">> Okay, but Okay, let me make sure I understand what's going"
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,16.239,18.785,on here. So we're looking at
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,18.785,20.83,three different algorithms that are learning algorithms.
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,20.83,21.0,>> Yep.
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,21.0,22.84,>> There's one One neural net
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,22.84,24.14,>> No
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,24.14,25.2,">> Okay, one nearest neighbor."
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,25.2,25.439999999999998,>> Mm-hm
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,25.44,27.62,>> K nearest neighbor and linear regression.
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,27.62,28.68,>> Yep
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,28.68,30.96,>> And for each one you want to know running time and space.
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,30.96,31.213,>> Mm-hm.
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,31.213,34.15,">> And this is on n points I assume, yeah, n"
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,34.15,36.699999999999996,"sort, what does it mean for data points to be sorted?"
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,36.7,38.89,>> So let's assume we're living in a world where all
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,38.89,42.05,of our data points are you know in r one. Okay.
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,42.05,44.089999999999996,>> Oh okay that well that. That could be sorted.
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,44.09,44.84,>> That could be. Yeah that could be
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,44.84,46.67,sorted. And that you know we are going to be
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,46.67,50.35,"out putting some real numbers as well. So they're points on a, on a number line."
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,50.35,53.800000000000004,So to make things simple for you. I'm going to
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,53.8,55.919999999999995,say that the points that your given are already sorted.
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,55.92,59.34,>> Oh ok alright. And yeah that makes sense. Its just
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,59.34,61.940000000000005,a scaler. So then a query point is going to come in.
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,61.94,65.03999999999999,And then its going to be some value. And were going to have
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,65.04,68.48100000000001,to find the nearest neighbor or do the linear regression or whatever.
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,68.481,68.71,>> Right.
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,68.71,70.25,>> Alright now that's for running time. For
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,70.25,73.72,now space your talking about the space of what.
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,73.72,75.42,>> How much space you are going to have
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,75.42,78.07000000000001,to do in order to accomplish your task. How much space
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,78.07,80.66999999999999,you going to have to use in order to accomplish your task?
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,80.67,82.81,>> So this is kind of like the the. The
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,82.81,87.02,space that's representing the class enviro. Or the regression. After training.
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,87.02,89.31,>> Yes. So actually that question
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,89.31,90.75,about after training is important. You'll notice
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,90.75,92.4,I've divided each of these algorithms
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,92.4,94.87,into two phases. There's the learning phase.
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,94.87,97.39,How much time it takes to learn. How much space you need to
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,97.39,100.44,learn. Then there's the query phase. When I give you some new value and
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,100.44,103.07,you have to output and answer. What's the running time for that
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,103.07,105.55,and what are the space requirements for that? Okay? You got that?
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,105.55,105.64999999999999,>> Yeah
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,105.65,109.24000000000001,>> I want that for each one. Of these three algorithms.
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,109.24,112.49,">> Except for one nearest neighbor which the, it appears"
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,112.49,114.44,as though you filled in for me to get me started.
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,114.44,116.23,>> Right so just to get you started and make it easier for you know
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,116.23,118.71000000000001,to know what I'm talking about. I'm talking about big o times here. Right. I'm
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,118.71,122.41999999999999,not going to make you write out big o. Big o is implicit. So if we
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,122.42,123.95,"look at one nearest neighbor, and we"
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,123.95,125.73,ask well what's the running time of learning?
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,125.73,129.53,"Well, it's constant. Right? Because there's no learning."
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,129.53,131.63,>> I see. You just take that sorted set of data
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,131.63,134.45,points and you just pass it along through the query here.
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,134.45,138.82999999999998,">> Right. Now, you could say that"" Well, I'm going to"
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,138.83,140.93,take the data points or I'm going to copy them into this
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,140.93,144.07,"database,"" and so it's linear. But let's assume they already come in"
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,144.07,146.38,"a data base, or some data structure that you can use, okay?"
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,146.38,147.14,>> Gotcha.
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,147.14,149.48,">> Okay, so now that actually brings us"
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,149.48,150.98,"to a nice little question about how much space,"
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,150.98,153.97,"learning takes here. And, well because you have to store those points,"
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,153.97,157.3,and keep them around. The space requirements are big O of N.
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,157.3,158.34,">> Yeah, that makes sense."
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,158.34,160.8,">> Okay, good. So given that as an example. Do"
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,160.8,164.95000000000002,"you think your one example in your data base. Mm, do"
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,164.95,168.23999999999998,you think you can use that to build up labels
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,168.24,170.68,for all the rest of the phases of the different algorithms?
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,170.68,171.62,">> Yeah, I think so."
xK3icFAiEJs,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,171.62,173.23000000000002,">> Okay, cool. Go for it."
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.34,1.34,"Okay Michael, are you ready?"

1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,389.29,391.58000000000004,"we swapped around, that's exactly right. So, why would"
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,391.58,394.65,"you care about that, well, let's see, I'll point"
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,394.65,396.51,"out something, which is though, even though we swapped"
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,396.51,398.37,out what was expensive in terms of time and
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,398.37,402.91,"what wasn't, you'll notice that. It's only logarithmic at"
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,402.91,407.12,query time for these first two but it's linear for
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,407.12,409.24,"the learning time, in, linear regression, so doesn't that"
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,409.24,412.11,mean that linear regression is always slower and worse?
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,412.11,415.94,">> No really, because we only have to"
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,415.94,418.43,"learn once, but we can query many, many times."
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,418.43,423.21,">> Right, right. So I guess if we query more than, you know,"
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,423.21,425.52,"n times for example ,it'll certainly be,"
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,425.52,428.03999999999996,worse overall. In terms of running time.
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,428.04,428.99,>> That's right.
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,428.99,429.44,>> Okay.
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,429.44,432.19,">> Though, it's, though it's interesting, because like when I see numbers"
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,432.19,435.46999999999997,"like this, my, my algorithm, hat tells me that"
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,435.47,437.52000000000004,I should try to balance them a little bit more.
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,437.52,440.14,"Like, here it's, it's you can make, learning ,essentially"
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,440.14,442.28,free and the other one you can make querying essentially
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,442.28,446.17999999999995,"free. Really you want to split those, somewhat evenly. Though"
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,446.18,447.72,"it's, not obvious to me how you would do that."
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,447.72,450.70000000000005,"Like, square root of n, learning time and then"
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,450.7,452.46999999999997,square root of n query time or something like that.
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,452.47,453.91,">> Yeah, but you did say something else that was"
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,453.91,455.77900000000005,important right? Which is that you only have to learn once.
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,457.21,458.41999999999996,">> Yeah, It's true."
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,458.42,460.88,">> So, the balance you know, really depends"
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,460.88,462.07,on how often you're going to do querying and
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,462.07,463.64,"exactly, what power it gives you. I mean,"
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,463.64,465.19,the trade off is really there. Don't you think?
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,465.19,467.66,">> Yeah, I guess so. I mean so, so specifically,"
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,467.66,470.20000000000005,"in the, in the version where you just query ones."
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,470.2,470.82,>> Right.
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,470.82,473.24,>> Then the balance thing could be more interesting.
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,473.24,474.94,">> Sure, okay, cool. All right anything else"
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,474.94,477.23,"you want to observe about this. Let's see,"
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,477.23,479.06,we got the trade off between learning versus
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,479.06,480.99,"querying. So, either you do all your work upfront,"
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,482.03,487.38,"or, you put it ,off ,and do your work only, when you're forced to at query time."
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,487.38,490.33,">> Yeah, I guess, well one thing, is, I want to point out that there's"
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,490.33,493.32,"a nice Mr. Rodgers, reference in the title. That was, that was very cool."
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,493.32,496.11,">> Thank you very much. And the second thing, is"
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,496.11,499.39,"that it does strike me, in a sense, that what's going"
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,499.39,501.7,"on here for the nearest neighbor algorithms, is that you"
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,501.7,504.44,"just put off ,doing any work until you absolutely have to."
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,504.44,505.641,>> Mm-hm.
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,505.641,509.45000000000005,>> Which strikes me as kind of a procrastinatory approach.
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,509.45,512.919,">> So that's a good word, that you used there, procrastinate."
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,512.919,515.539,"The words that people use, in the literature, are ,uh, lazy."
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,515.539,517.669,>> Mm.
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,517.669,520.169,">> They say that these are lazy learners, versus"
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,520.169,522.9,"something like linear regression, which is an eager learner."
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,522.9,524.29,>> Eager.
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,524.29,527.87,">> Yes. So, linear regression, is eager, it wants to learn right away, and it"
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,527.87,530.51,"does, but nearest neighbor algorithms are lazy. They"
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,530.51,534.566,"want to put off, learning until they absolutely ,have"
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,534.566,538.029,"to, and so we refer to this class ,as lazy and this class as eager."
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,538.029,540.95,">> I See, so I guess its the case, that, if"
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,540.95,544.34,"we never query it, then the lazy learner definitely comes out ahead."
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,544.34,545.69,">> Right, that makes sense."
1t6Wm37e1VM,Wont You Compute My Neighbors Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,545.69,546.6,>> Yeah.

X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,63.796,65.821,>> And now I'll do all the rest of them
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,65.821,70.0,"'cause I pre-computed them of Four, six, eight, four, six. Alright,"
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,70.0,71.48,so now we've got it set up so we can do
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,71.48,75.74000000000001,"one and three nearest neighbor relatively quickly. So, the one nearest"
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,75.74,78.52,"neighbor, the closest distance, is four."
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,78.52,79.33999999999999,>> Mm--hm.
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,79.34,80.86,>> But unfortauntely there are two points
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,80.86,82.29,that have that two comma four in set
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,82.29,84.35000000000001,number one. We have outputs of eight and
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,84.35,86.67999999999999,50 because they. Almost agree with each other.
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,86.68,87.91300000000001,>> Uh-huh.
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,87.913,92.94,>> Not. And if we take the average of those two things we get 29.
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,92.94,94.99,>> Yep. That is correct Michael.
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,94.99,101.38,>> Great now in terms of the three nearest neighbors we have the fours and
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,101.38,101.91,the sixes.
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,103.24,105.038,">> So the four, three nearest neighbors."
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,105.038,105.413,>> Yep.
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,105.413,110.97,>> Somewhat awkwardly. And the we have the average of those things which is
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,110.97,113.76,"what. Eight, fifty and sixteen and sixty"
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,113.76,116.06,eight which gets us thirty five point five.
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,116.06,120.64,">> Right. Obviously. [LAUGH] Okay. Alright,"
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,120.64,122.54,so that was pretty straightforward. And those
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,122.54,126.11,answers aren't too far off from one another. So what about the Euclidean case?
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,126.11,126.92999999999999,">> Alright,"
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,126.93,129.53,"so one thing to point out. I, I was worried"
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,129.53,131.62,about computing square roots but it occurs to me that
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,131.62,134.02,I actually don't have to compute square roots because that's
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,134.02,137.17000000000002,"the monotonic transformation, and we only care about the orders."
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,137.17,138.23999999999998,">> Hm, okay."
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,138.24,142.45000000000002,">> So for Euclidean distance, or as I like to call him casually, ED,"
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,142.45,143.22,>> Mmhm.
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,143.22,146.46,>> We can just take the square differences summed up.
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,146.46,148.17000000000002,">> Okay, so this would be ED squared."
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,148.17,150.13,">> Yes, it would be ED squared."
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,150.13,151.59,">> Okay, ED."
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,151.59,152.04,>> Good.
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,152.04,157.394,"So the first one, it'll be the one minus four is three, squared is nine. And the"
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,157.394,162.96,"6 minus 2 is 4, squared is 16. And 9 plus 16 is 25. So the first one will be 25."
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,162.96,164.96,>> And notice the square of 25 is pretty easy to compute.
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,164.96,167.73000000000002,">> Yeah, but the other ones aren't going to be. It just"
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,167.73,169.95999999999998,so happens that we've got a pythagorean triple on our hands.
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,169.96,172.43,>> Mm. I love those.
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,172.43,177.006,">> Al right so the remaining ones, the x squared are eight,"
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,177.006,179.31,"26, 40, ten, and 20."
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,179.31,181.31,">> Hm, none of"
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,183.4,184.78,those are easily square rootable.
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,184.78,188.84,">> Exactly, though 40 feels like it really was trying and failed."
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,188.84,193.19,>> Yeah. An eight over shot and now it's
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,193.19,196.12,"a perfect cube. So, eight is the smallest distance."
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,196.12,196.4,>> Yep.
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,196.4,199.66,">> And again, seemingly, coincidentally, they"
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,199.66,201.45,"Y value associated with that, is eight."
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,201.45,202.45999999999998,>> Hm.
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,202.46,204.139,">> So an eight, eight is our answer."
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,205.61,206.66000000000003,>> Good and that's correct.
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,206.66,208.48,">> And the three closest are eight, ten and 20."
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,208.48,208.61999999999998,>> Mm-hmm.
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,208.62,209.12,>> And if we
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,211.82,217.60999999999999,"average the Y values for those that's eight, 50 and 68, which gives us"
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,217.61,222.91000000000003,"an average of 42. The meaning of life, the universe. And pretty much everything?"
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,222.91,226.82,>> Yes! And that is absolutely correct. So that's kind of That's kind
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,226.82,229.95,of cool that you get completely different answers depending upon what you do.
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,229.95,231.79999999999998,">> Yeah, it does seem very different, doesn't it?"
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,231.8,234.29000000000002,I mean there's like several orders of magnitude spread here.
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,234.29,235.28,">> Well, that's."
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,235.28,236.94,>> Maybe not orders of magnitude but orders of doubling.
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,236.94,240.39,">> Yes, there are orders of doubling spread. Well, you know what"
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,240.39,243.26,"Michael, I actually had a specific function in mind when I did this."
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,243.26,246.39999999999998,>> Okay! Let's find out which one is the right one!
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,246.4,249.9,">> Well, the function I had was Y was equal to the"
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,249.9,253.78,"first dimension squared plus the second dimension. So, let's call that X1"
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,253.78,259.01,"and X2, and this was actually the function that I had in"
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,259.01,261.24,"place. So, you square the first term and you add the second."
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,261.24,262.46000000000004,">> Okay, and"
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,262.46,265.2,"so like looking at the second last one, for example, seven"
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,265.2,270.02,"squared is 49 plus one is 50 Oh, [UNKNOWN]. It's very consistent."
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,270.02,273.12,>> Thank you. So what would be the actual answer for four comma two?
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,273.12,279.05,>> Okay so four squared is 16 plus two is 18. Which is close to none of them.
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,279.05,283.98,">> Right. So there's a lesson here, there's several lessons"
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,283.98,287.70000000000005,here. And one lesson I don't want you to take away.
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,287.7,289.75,So here's the lesson. So I actually had a
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,289.75,292.54,real function here. There was no noise. It was fairly
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,292.54,296.41,well represented. The proper answer was 18 and basically none
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,296.41,298.81,of these are right. But the first thing I want
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,298.81,301.56,"you to notice is you get completely different answers, depending"
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,301.56,305.76,"upon exactly whether you do one versus three, whether you"
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,305.76,308.92,do Euclidean versus Manhattan. And that's because these things make
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,308.92,312.51,assumptions about your domain that might not be particularly relevant.
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,315.05,318.25,"And this sort of suggests, that maybe this thing"
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,318.25,323.09,"doesn't do very well. Uh, kNN doesn't do very well because"
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,323.09,325.31,none of these are close to 18. That seems
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,325.31,327.38,a little sad. But I've good new for you Michael.
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,327.38,328.12,>> Okay.
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,328.12,330.97,">> The good news is that, actually kNN tends to"
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,330.97,334.98,"work really, really well. Especially given it's simplicity, it just"
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,334.98,338.15000000000003,doesn't in this particular case. And there's really a reason
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,338.15,340.79999999999995,"for that, and it has to do with this sort of."
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,340.8,346.04,"Fundamental assumptions in bias of kNN, I happen to pick an example that"
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,346.04,349.34000000000003,sort of violates some of that bias. So I think it's worth to take a moment
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,349.34,354.5,to think about what the preference bias is for kNN and to see
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,354.5,356.73,if that can lead us to understanding why
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,356.73,358.3,we didn't get anything close to 18 here.
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,358.3,359.58,>> Okay that sounds useful.
X8tm6x2k_gQ,Domain K NNowledge Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,359.58,360.62,">> Okay, so let's do that."
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.2,2.08,"Ok, Michael, so I'm going to talk a little bit"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,2.08,5.525,"about bias. In particular, the preference bias for K"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,5.525,8.95,"[INAUDIBLE]. So, let me remind you what preference bias"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,8.95,13.219999999999999,is. Preference bias is kind of our notion of
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,13.22,16.7,why we would prefer one hypothesis over another. And
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,16.7,19.0,"they say all things, other things being equal. And"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,19.0,21.95,"what that really means is, it's the thing that"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,21.95,26.25,encompasses our belief. About what makes a good hypothesis.
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,26.25,27.57,So in some of the previous examples that
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,27.57,30.79,"we used it was things like shorter trees,"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,30.79,36.518,"smoother functions, simpler functions, Occam's Razor, those sorts of"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,36.518,39.793,things were the ways that we expressed our preferences
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,39.793,43.41,over various hypothesis. And kNN is no exception.
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,43.41,45.06999999999999,It also has preference by its built in
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,45.07,51.28,as does every algorithm of any note. So I just wanted to go through three that I
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,51.28,54.77,"thought of is as being indicitive of this bias. And they're,"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,54.77,57.03,kind of all related to one another. So the first one
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,57.03,61.46,is a notion of locality. Right? There's this idea that near
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,61.46,64.65,points are similiar to one another. Does that make sense to you?
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,64.65,67.15,>> Yeah. Yeah. That was really important. It came out
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,67.15,69.95,nicely in the the real estate example. Right. So the
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,69.95,72.61,whole idea. The whole thing we are using to generalize
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,72.61,75.03,from one thing to another is this notion of nearness.
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,75.03,76.58,>> Right. And exactly
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,76.58,78.77,how this notion of nearness works out.
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,78.77,80.91,Is embedded in whatever distance function we happen
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,80.91,82.36,"to be given. And so, there's further"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,82.36,85.11,"bias that might come out, based upon exactly"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,85.11,86.78,"the way we implement distances. So, in"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,86.78,89.63,"the example we just did, euclidian distance is"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,89.63,91.82,making a different assumption about what nearness or
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,91.82,94.72999999999999,"similarity is, compared to Manhattan distance, for example."
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,94.73,97.55,">> So is there like, a perfect distance function for a given problem?"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,97.55,101.97,>> There's certainly a perfect distance function for any particular problem.
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,101.97,104.25,">> Yeah, that's what I mean. Not one that works for the"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,104.25,108.38,"universe, but one, like, you know, if I give you a problem and"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,108.38,110.6,"you can work on it all day long. Can you find, is"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,110.6,111.72,there a notion that there''s a
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,111.72,114.72,distance function that would capture things perfectly?
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,114.72,119.67,">> Well, it has to be the case for any given fixed problem. That there"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,119.67,124.26,"is some distance function that minimizes, say,"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,124.26,127.58,sum of squared errors or something like that.
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,127.58,129.68,First is some other distance function. Right?
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,129.68,130.59,>> Okay.
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,130.59,132.51,">> That has to be the case. So there, there always to"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,132.51,136.59,be at least one best distance function given everything else is fixed.
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,136.59,137.89000000000001,>> That makes sense.
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,137.89,140.39999999999998,">> Right. Now, what that is, who"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,140.4,144.69,knows. Maybe you finding it might be. Arbitrarily
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,144.69,147.56,"difficult. Because there's at least an infinite, there's"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,147.56,149.915,at least an infinite number of distance functions.
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,149.915,152.78,">> Well yeah, I was thinking that, that for latter to find distance functions"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,152.78,156.35,to be anything we want. What about a distance function that said
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,156.35,160.09,"the distance between all the things that have the same answer, is zero."
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,160.09,160.643,>> Mm-hm.
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,160.643,162.18,>> And the distance between them and the ones that
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,162.18,165.09,"have different answers is you know, infinity or something big."
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,165.09,165.31,>> Yeah.
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,165.31,167.67000000000002,">> And then, then the distance function,"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,167.67,169.67999999999998,"like, somehow already has built in the solution"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,169.68,171.35,to the problem because it's already put
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,171.35,172.85,the things that have the same answers together.
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,172.85,174.82,">> Right, you could do that, and of course, doing"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,174.82,178.65,"that would require again solving the original problem. But yeah, so."
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,178.65,181.24,"So, such a function has to exist, or, well, you"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,181.24,183.65,"know, there's always noise. What if there's noise in your data,"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,183.65,185.87,you know? But some such function like that has to
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,185.87,188.93,"exist, the question is finding it. But I think the real"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,188.93,191.15,"point to take there is, there are some good distance"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,191.15,193.46,functions for our problem and there are some bad distance functions
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,193.46,197.01000000000002,for our problem. And how you pick those is really fundamental
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,197.01,199.63,assumption your making about the domain. That's why it's domain knowledge.
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,199.63,201.6,">> Yeah, that sounds right."
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,201.6,203.78,">> Mm 'Kay. So, locality however it's expressed"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,203.78,206.91,"to the distance function, that is similarity. It's built"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,206.91,209.244,in to kNN that we believe that near points
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,209.244,212.29,are similar. Kind of by definition. That leads actually
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,212.29,214.26999999999998,to the second preference bias which is this notion of
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,214.27,219.87,smoothness. Alright. That we are by choosing to average.
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,219.87,222.13,And by choosing to look at points that are similar
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,222.13,225.07,"to one another. We are expecting functions to behave,"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,225.07,228.73,"smoothly. Alright, so, you know, in the 2D case."
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,228.73,232.53,"It's, it's kind of easy to see, right? You, you, you, you have these,"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,232.53,235.07,these sort of points and you're basically
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,235.07,237.47,"saying, look, these two points should somehow be"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,237.47,242.6,related to one another more than this point and this point. And that sort
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,242.6,246.37,of assumes kind of smoothly changing behavior
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,246.37,248.56,as you move from one neighborhood to another.
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,251.39,251.79,Does that make sense?
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,251.79,255.23999999999998,">> I mean, it seems like we're defining to be pretty similar to locality."
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,255.24,259.64,">> In this case. So I'm, I'm drawing an example, such that, you know,"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,259.64,262.75,whatever we meant by locality has already been kind of expressed in the graph.
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,262.75,263.45,>> Okay.
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,263.45,265.94,">> And you know, by picking, you know, this is really for pedagogical"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,265.94,268.725,"reasons. You know can imagine, this you know, these are points that live in"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,268.725,271.48,"77,000 dimensions, and it's impossible to actually"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,271.48,273.09000000000003,visualize them much less draw them. And
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,273.09,274.51,"I could try. [LAUGH] But here's, here's"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,274.51,276.90999999999997,three dimensions and here's the fourth dimension.
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,277.92,280.25,I think I'm going to get tired before I hit seven and seven thousand
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,280.25,283.27,"but, you know, you kind of, you kind of get the idea, right? That, if. In,"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,283.27,285.45,"you know, if you can imagine in your head points that are really"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,285.45,287.59,"near one another in some space, you"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,287.59,290.27,kind of hope that they behave similarly. Right.
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,290.27,293.34999999999997,">> Right. Okay, so locality and smoothness. And I think these make sense. I"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,293.35,294.46000000000004,"mean, these, this is hardly the only"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,294.46,296.09999999999997,algorithm that makes these kind of assumptions.
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,296.1,299.81,But there is another assumption which is a bit more subtle I think. Which
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,299.81,303.37,"is worth spending a second talking about, which is, for at least the distance"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,303.37,307.52,functions we've looked at before. The Euclidian distance and
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,307.52,311.5,the Manhattan distance. They all kind of looked at each
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,311.5,314.6,"of the dimensions, sort of, and subtracted them, and"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,314.6,316.78000000000003,"squared them, or didn't, or took their absolute value and"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,316.78,319.80999999999995,"added them all together. What that means is, we"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,319.81,322.06,"were treating, at least in those cases, that all the"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,322.06,324.32,"features mattered. And not only did they matter, they"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,324.32,328.53,mattered equally. Right. So think about the the last quiz
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,328.53,334.5,I gave you. Right. It said y equals x 1 squared plus x 2. And you noticed we
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,334.5,336.32,got answers that were wildly off from what the
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,336.32,338.46999999999997,actual answer was. Well if I know that the
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,338.47,341.89000000000004,first dimension. The first feature is going to be squared
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,341.89,343.95,and the second one is not going to be
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,343.95,347.06,squared. Do you think either one of these features
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,347.06,348.97,is more important or more important to get right?
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,350.19,352.46,">> Okay. Right. Trying to think about what that might mean. So,"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,353.8,357.38,"if, yea its definitely the case that when you look"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,357.38,360.11,for similar examples in the database you want to care
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,360.11,363.02000000000004,more about X1 because a little bit of a difference
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,363.02,366.58,in X1 gets squared out. Right? It can lead to a
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,366.58,370.90999999999997,very large difference in the corresponding Y value. Whereas in
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,370.91,373.79,"the x2's, it's not quite as crucial. Th, th, the,"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,373.79,375.83000000000004,"if you're off a little bit more, then you're off"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,375.83,378.9,"a little bit more, it's just a linear relationship. So yeah,"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,378.9,381.35999999999996,it does seems like that first dimension needs to be a lot
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,381.36,385.15000000000003,"more important, I guess, when you're doing the matching. Then the second one."
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,385.15,386.66999999999996,">> Right so, we probably would have gotten"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,386.67,387.86,"different, I'm not going to go through this but,"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,387.86,391.25,"we probably would have gotten different answers if, in"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,391.25,394.37,the Euclidian or Manhattan case we had instead of
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,394.37,397.33,just taking the difference between the first two The
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,397.33,400.0,"first dimensions, we had taken that difference and squared"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,400.0,401.81,"it. And then in the case, including this and"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,401.81,404.38,"squaring it again, and then some of those things"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,404.38,406.02,that were closer in the first dimension instead
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,406.02,408.29999999999995,of the second dimension would've looked more similar and
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,408.3,409.98,we might've gotten better answer. That's probably a good
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,409.98,412.26500000000004,exercise to go back and do for someone else.
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,412.265,414.15,">> [LAUGH] Yeah, I was thinking of doing it right"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,414.15,416.15999999999997,"now, but yeah, probably should leave it for other people."
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,416.16,419.5,>> Well you can do it if you want to. So did you do it Michael?
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,419.5,421.096,>> I did.
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,421.096,422.289,>> And?
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,422.289,425.14,>> So it's a kind of now a mix between the Manhattan distance
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,425.14,426.7,"and the Euclidian distance. So, I'm taking"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,426.7,429.7,"the first component, take the difference, square"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,429.7,429.84,it.
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,429.84,430.255,>> Mm-hm.
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,430.255,432.35,">> Take the second component, take the difference,"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,432.35,434.8,absolute value it. And add those two things together.
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,434.8,435.87,>> Sure.
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,435.87,438.44,">> All right. So if I do that, with one nearest neighbor,"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,438.44,441.28,"I still get that tie, but the output answer ends up being 12."
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,441.28,441.78,>> Hm. Which
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,443.98,445.199,is better than 24.7.
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,445.199,447.49,">> And that's better than eight, which is what"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,447.49,449.26,it was before. So the eight has gone up to
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,449.26,452.03999999999996,"12, which is better than the other one, which I"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,452.04,454.6,"think was 35.5, comes down to 29.5 Close here again"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,454.6,457.12,to the correct answer which is eighteen. So in
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,457.12,459.51,"both cases it kind of pushed in the right direction,"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,459.51,462.64,"it was using more, of the, the answers that were"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,462.64,464.68,relevant and fewer of the answers that were not relevant.
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,464.68,469.14,">> Right. There you go. So the notion of relevance by the way,"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,469.14,474.09999999999997,"turns out to be very, very important. And highlights a weakness of"
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,474.1,478.22,kNN. So this brings me to a kind of theorem or fundamental
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,478.22,483.32000000000005,results of a machine learning that is particularly relevant to kNN but
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,483.32,487.06,its actually relevant everywhere. Do you think its worth while to mention it?
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,487.06,488.13,>> Sure it sounds very relevant.
BXX_L4vd4Bs,K NN Bias - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,488.13,488.79,>> Alright let's do it.
QZ0DtNFdDko,Curse of Dimensionality - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.33,3.94,"Okay, Michael. So this notion of having different features or different"
QZ0DtNFdDko,Curse of Dimensionality - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,3.94,10.459999999999999,dimensions throw us off has a name and it's called the Curse of Dimensionality.
QZ0DtNFdDko,Curse of Dimensionality - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,10.46,12.97,">> Oh, nice audio effect."
QZ0DtNFdDko,Curse of Dimensionality - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,12.97,16.94,>> I did like that effect in post-production. And
QZ0DtNFdDko,Curse of Dimensionality - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,16.94,19.32,"it refers to well, a very particular thing. So let"
QZ0DtNFdDko,Curse of Dimensionality - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,19.32,21.32,me just read out what it refers to. As
QZ0DtNFdDko,Curse of Dimensionality - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,21.32,25.37,"the number of features or equivalently ,uh, dimensions grows that"
QZ0DtNFdDko,Curse of Dimensionality - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,25.37,29.1,"is as we add more and more features we go x of 1, x of two then"
QZ0DtNFdDko,Curse of Dimensionality - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,29.1,30.6,"we add x of three, add more and"
QZ0DtNFdDko,Curse of Dimensionality - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,30.6,32.83,more of these features. As those features grows or
QZ0DtNFdDko,Curse of Dimensionality - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,32.83,38.71,"as the number of dimensions grow ,the amount of data ,that we"
QZ0DtNFdDko,Curse of Dimensionality - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,38.71,44.63,need to generalize accurately also grows exponentially. Now this
QZ0DtNFdDko,Curse of Dimensionality - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,44.63,50.59,"is a problem of course because Exponentially means, bad in computer science land"
QZ0DtNFdDko,Curse of Dimensionality - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,50.59,54.1,because when things are exponential they're effectively untenable.
QZ0DtNFdDko,Curse of Dimensionality - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,54.1,57.07,"You just, you just, you sort of can't win."
QZ0DtNFdDko,Curse of Dimensionality - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,57.07,60.06,">> I think everybody knows that in the sense that if you look,"
QZ0DtNFdDko,Curse of Dimensionality - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,60.06,64.12,"I've done this experiment actually, if you look in the popular press like,"
QZ0DtNFdDko,Curse of Dimensionality - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,64.12,69.12,"you know, Time Magazine Or New York Times, USA Today. People will use"
QZ0DtNFdDko,Curse of Dimensionality - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,69.12,71.13000000000001,the word exponentially sometimes to mean
QZ0DtNFdDko,Curse of Dimensionality - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,71.13,74.06,"exponentially, and sometimes to mean, a lot."
QZ0DtNFdDko,Curse of Dimensionality - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,74.06,75.76,>> Yeah that's actually a pet peeve of mine.
QZ0DtNFdDko,Curse of Dimensionality - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,75.76,76.75,"The whole notion of,"
QZ0DtNFdDko,Curse of Dimensionality - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,76.75,77.3,>> Me too.
QZ0DtNFdDko,Curse of Dimensionality - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,77.3,79.25999999999999,">> Oh, it's exponentially bigger. No,"
QZ0DtNFdDko,Curse of Dimensionality - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,79.26,80.41000000000001,"that's, that's not meaningful. If you're"
QZ0DtNFdDko,Curse of Dimensionality - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,80.41,83.42,"saying I have one point. And then I have another point, and I"
QZ0DtNFdDko,Curse of Dimensionality - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,83.42,86.38,want to say this one point is exponentially bigger than this one. That's
QZ0DtNFdDko,Curse of Dimensionality - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,86.38,88.86999999999999,meaningless! It's also liberally bigger than
QZ0DtNFdDko,Curse of Dimensionality - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,88.87,91.98,that one. Exponentially refers to a trend.
QZ0DtNFdDko,Curse of Dimensionality - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,91.98,93.42,">> Again, their,their,their not talking about the"
QZ0DtNFdDko,Curse of Dimensionality - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,93.42,95.399,mathematical relationship. They just mean a lot.

QZ0DtNFdDko,Curse of Dimensionality - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,100.76,104.32000000000001,I'm willing to accept it for the purposes of this discussion. Okay.
QZ0DtNFdDko,Curse of Dimensionality - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,104.32,108.13999999999999,"Exponentially means bad. It means that we need more, and more, and more,"
QZ0DtNFdDko,Curse of Dimensionality - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,108.14,110.96,and more data as we add features and dimensions. Now as a machine

QZ0DtNFdDko,Curse of Dimensionality - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,119.47,122.87,important. So why don't we just keep adding more and more and more
QZ0DtNFdDko,Curse of Dimensionality - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,122.87,125.85000000000001,"features. You know, we've got all these sensors and we'll just add this"

QZ0DtNFdDko,Curse of Dimensionality - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,131.32,133.72,we'll figure out which ones are important. But the curse
QZ0DtNFdDko,Curse of Dimensionality - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,133.72,135.77,of dimensionality says that every time you add another one

QZ0DtNFdDko,Curse of Dimensionality - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,144.94,145.81,>> Mm.

QZ0DtNFdDko,Curse of Dimensionality - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,176.62,178.74,"it helps to kind of draw a picture,"
QZ0DtNFdDko,Curse of Dimensionality - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,178.74,180.26000000000002,and so I'm going to draw a little picture. Okay?
QZ0DtNFdDko,Curse of Dimensionality - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,180.26,181.17999999999998,>> Yeah.
QZ0DtNFdDko,Curse of Dimensionality - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,181.18,181.76000000000002,>> All right.

OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,27.06,30.869999999999997,kind of uniformly distributed across the line segment. So that means

OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,35.34,40.190000000000005,equal size sub segment of this segment. Does that make sense?

OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,45.97,51.11,you're trying to estimate values of other places on the line it's going to

OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,52.7,55.36,that point so there's a very small little

OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,60.73,62.32,>> That is exactly right and in fact each one
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,62.32,65.44,of these green X's represents. How much of this segment?

OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,70.65,73.96000000000001,>> That's exactly right. You cover one tenth. Alright
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,73.96,76.22,"Michael, so let's say I move from a line"
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,76.22,79.56,segment now to a two dimensional space. So
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,79.56,83.23,a little square segment. If that's the right
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,83.23,85.85000000000001,technical term. And I've taken my little ten

OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,88.89,91.96,here's something you'll notice; you'll notice that each
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,91.96,94.85,one of these x's is going to still end
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,94.85,98.41,"up representing one-tenth of all of this space,"
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,98.41,101.41799999999999,"but you'll also notice that, that, that it's representing"
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,101.418,105.18,now you know. Really really really really big.
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,106.71,107.00999999999999,>> I see.
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,107.01,110.06,">> So one way of putting it is, you know if you think"

OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,112.32,114.11,the furthest point which would be incorrect.

OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,130.81,135.07,the x's I put down represents the same amount of. I

OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,139.31,141.96,segment over here. So what do you think I have to do?
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,141.96,145.84,>> I feel like you need to fill up the square with xs.
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,145.84,148.48,">> Yeah, that's exactly right so let's do that. So"
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,148.48,151.70999999999998,filling em up Michael as you suggested. You'll notice that
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,151.71,154.49,at least if we pretend that I drew this right. Each of
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,154.49,158.33,these X's is now going to end up being the nearest neighbor for
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,158.33,164.17000000000002,"a little square like this, and the diameter of these little squares are"

OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,167.92,170.66,">> Yeah, I agree for some definition of the word diameter."
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,170.66,173.79999999999998,">> Yes, and for some definition of our demonstration. Okay, so how"

OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,180.401,182.62,you did ten by ten so that'll be 100.

OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,187.01,191.01,"from needing ten points to, of course, 100 points"
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,191.01,193.87,in order to cover the same amount of space.
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,193.87,197.14000000000001,">> Alright, so that definitely seems like the mild rebuke of dimensionality."
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,197.14,197.98999999999998,>> Yes.
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,197.99,199.53,>> But doesn't seem that bad.

OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,203.76,206.89999999999998,"So now, if I want to cover the same amount of, you know,"

OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,209.0,210.77,definition of diameter. I'm going to have

OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,217.69,220.51,it'll just kind of go and fill up some space and you

OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,241.45,243.35999999999999,just like scribbling on the side of the cube.
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,243.36,244.16000000000003,>> These are X's.
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,244.16,247.84,">> You, you were doing so well for awhile, and then just lost it entirely."

OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,252.21,254.79000000000002,>> Hm. No
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,254.79,257.87,"because I would use computers to help me but yes, yes it is very"
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,257.87,261.7,frustrating to have to have that many x's. And so but in particular in
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,261.7,265.77,"this case we're talking about data points in a nearest neighbor method and that,"
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,265.77,269.346,boy that does seem like a big growth from ten to a 100 to 1000.

OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,284.267,288.18399999999997,"need 100,000 points. And in six dimensions, we would need 1,000,000"
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,288.184,291.99,points. And so on and so forth. So something like.

OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,294.07,295.37,>> Wow.
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,295.37,297.88,>> Right. So this is really problematic right.

OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,305.47,308.53000000000003,I'm going to need to grow the number of points that
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,308.53,312.09999999999997,I have in my training set exponentially. And that's really bad.
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,312.1,314.91200000000003,"And by the way, this isn't just an issue of"

OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,320.29,324.95000000000005,of it as points that are representing or covering the space.
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,324.95,327.34,And if you want to represent the same sort of hyper-volume

OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,334.03,336.63,coverage is necessary to do learning. So the curse

OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,338.83,341.93,It is a curse of dimensionality for ML period [SOUND].
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,341.93,344.99,>> You mean for me?

OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,349.252,353.03000000000003,>> [LAUGH] Okay. And that seems really problematic because it's very

OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,362.82,365.15,giving it a larger and larger volume to fill.
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,365.15,368.29999999999995,>> Yeah. And it can't fill it unless you give it more and more
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,368.3,371.12,data. So you're better off giving more data than you are giving more dimensions.
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,371.12,371.91,>> Zoinks.
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,371.91,375.65000000000003,>> Mm-hm. There's an entire series of lessons that

OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,381.54,382.04,>> Yeah.
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,383.52,384.43,>> That would be a useful thing.
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,384.43,386.56,>> It would. But it's far off in the future. It's like infinitely
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,386.56,388.98,far in the future. So we'll worry about that in a few weeks.
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,388.98,390.15000000000003,>> Okay.
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,390.15,392.76,">> Okay. All right. So there you go, Michael."
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,392.76,396.2,Curse of Dimensionality is real and it's a real problem.

OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,402.42,404.96000000000004,">> Oh, Bellman, like the dynamic programming guy."
OyPcbeiwps8,Curse of Dimensionality Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,404.96,406.36199999999997,">> Yeah, the dynamic programming guy,"

_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.49,2.4690000000000003,"Okay, Michael so we talked a little bit about the curse of dimensionality,"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,2.469,5.5,but I think it's worthwhile to talk about some other stuff that comes
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,5.5,7.6,up. We've been sort of skirting around this and you know bring it
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,7.6,12.36,up in various ways throughout our discussion so far. But I think it's worthwhile
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,12.36,15.059999999999999,kind of writing them all down on a slide and trying to think
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,15.06,18.1,"through them for a little bit. So ,uh, the other stuff that comes"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,18.1,21.232000000000003,up in [UNKNOWN] mainly comes up in these sort of assumptions we make
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,21.232,25.671,"about parameters to the algorithm. So the one we talked about ,uh, probably the"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,25.671,28.155,"most is our distance measure, you know our"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,28.155,30.777,distance between some X and some query point Q
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,30.777,33.480000000000004,and we've explored a couple. We looked at
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,33.48,37.779999999999994,Eucudean and we looked at Manhattan. And we even
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,37.78,40.68,looked at weighted versions of those. And this
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,40.68,42.86,"really matters, I've said this before but I really"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,42.86,45.339999999999996,think it bears repeating that your choice of
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,45.34,50.910000000000004,distance function Really matters. If you pick the wrong
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,50.91,53.699999999999996,"kind of distance function, you're just going to get very poor behavior."
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,53.7,57.760000000000005,">> So I, so I have a question about these these distance functions."
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,57.76,59.669999999999995,"So you mentioned Euclidean and Manhattan,"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,59.67,61.04,are there other distance functions that the
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,61.04,64.51,"students should know? Like, things that they, that might come up, or things"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,64.51,66.92,that they should think of first if they have a particular kind of data?
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,68.06,71.15,">> yeah, there's a, there's a ton of them. I think Well, first off,"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,71.15,73.26,"it, it's probably worth pointing out that"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,73.26,75.98,"this, this notion of weighted distance is one"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,75.98,78.58,way to deal with the curse of dimensionality. You can weight
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,78.58,81.61,"different dimensions differently. And that would be one, and you might"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,81.61,84.1,"come up with sort of automatic ways of doing that. That,"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,84.1,87.25999999999999,that's sort of worth mentioning. But you will notice that both Euclidean
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,87.26,90.56,"and Manhattan distance at least as we have talked about them,"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,90.56,94.64,are really useful for things like regression. Their kind of assuming
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,94.64,98.11,that you have numbers in that subtraction kind of makes sense.
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,98.11,101.34,"But there are other functions, distance functions that you might do if"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,101.34,106.504,"you are dealing with cases like, I don't know Discrete"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,106.504,110.76,"data, right? Where instead of it all being numbers, it's colors,"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,110.76,114.73,"or something like that. Alright so, your distance might be mismatches."
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,114.73,116.87,"For example, or it might be a mixture of those. In"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,116.87,118.80000000000001,"fact, one of the nice things about KNN, is that"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,118.8,120.67,"we've been talking about it with points, because it's sort of"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,120.67,122.95,easy to think about it that way. But this distance function
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,122.95,127.16,is just a black box. You can take Arbitrary things and
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,127.16,129.539,try to decide how similar they are based on whatever you
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,129.539,132.125,know about the domain and that could be very useful. So
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,132.125,134.96,",you could talk about images right, where you take pictures of"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,134.96,138.16,people and you know rather than doing something like a pixel
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,138.16,141.96,"by pixel comparison, you try to line up their eyes. And"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,141.96,144.75,"look at their mouths, and try to see if they're the"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,144.75,147.74,"same shape you know things like that, that might be more"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,147.74,149.69,complicated and and perhaps even arbitrarily
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,149.69,152.57,computational to determine notions of similarity
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,152.57,155.62,so really this idea of distance in similarity tells
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,155.62,156.83,you a lot about your domain and what you
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,156.83,159.19000000000003,"believe about it. ,another thing that's worth what what's"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,159.19,161.73,pushing on a little bit is how you pick k.
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,161.73,163.44,Well there's no good was to pick k you
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,163.44,166.57999999999998,"just You just have to know something about it, but"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,166.58,168.59,"I want to think about a particular case. Well,"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,168.59,171.915,what if we end up in a world where K=N.
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,171.915,172.76,">> Well, that would be silly."
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,172.76,173.79999999999998,>> Why would it be silly?
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,173.8,177.74,">> Well, so if K=N, then what you're doing is you're taking, so in the case"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,177.74,179.54000000000002,"of regression for example, you're taking all"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,179.54,182.92999999999998,of the data points and averaging the.
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,182.93,186.08,Y values together. Basically ignoring the query.
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,186.08,188.53,"So, you end up with a constant function."
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,188.53,190.31,>> But that's only if you do a
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,190.31,192.48,simple average. What if you do a weighted average?
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,196.1,199.04,">> A weighted average. So the near, the points that are"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,199.04,201.51999999999998,"the query are going to get more weight in the average, so"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,201.52,205.20000000000002,"that acually will be diffrent. Even though k equals n, it"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,205.2,208.17,will be different depending on where you actually put your query down.
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,208.17,212.17999999999998,">> Exactly. That's exactly right so, for example, if I have"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,212.18,215.82,a little bunch of points like this say. Where you notice it
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,215.82,218.48,kind of looks like I have two different lines here and
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,218.48,221.29999999999998,"I can pick a query point way over here, all of these"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,221.3,224.67000000000002,points are going to influence me as oppose to these points and
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,224.67,228.23999999999998,so I'm going to end up. Estimating with something that looks more
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,228.24,231.99,like this because these points over here won't have much to
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,231.99,234.54000000000002,say. But if I have a query point that's way over here
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,234.54,237.01,somewhere these points are going to matter and I'm going to end up
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,237.01,239.76,looking something looks a little bit more like this than like
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,239.76,242.88,that. Now I'm drawing these as lines. They won't exactly look
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,242.88,246.29999999999998,like lines because these points will have some influence. They'll be more
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,246.3,249.17000000000002,"curvy than that. But the point is that near, near"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,249.17,250.86999999999998,the place we want to do the query it will
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,250.87,253.88,look To be more strongly influenced by these points over
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,253.88,256.88,here or these points over here depending on where you are.
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,256.88,258.45,>> Well that gives me an idea.
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,258.45,259.89,">> Oh, what kind of idea does it give you?"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,259.89,261.91999999999996,">> Well, what about instead of just taking"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,261.92,264.90000000000003,"a weighted average, what about using the distance matrix"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,264.9,266.92999999999995,to pick up some of the points? And
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,266.93,270.22,then do a different regression on that substantive point.
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,270.22,271.38000000000005,">> Right, I like that."
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,271.38,272.92,So we can replace this whole notion of
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,272.92,276.27000000000004,"average with a more kind of, regression-y thing."
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,276.27,279.08,">> So it actually, instead of using the same value for"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,279.08,282.25,"the whole patch. Actually, it still continues to use the input values."
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,282.25,285.16,">> Yeah. So, in fact, average is just"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,285.16,286.89000000000004,"a special case of a kind of regression, right?"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,286.89,287.52,">> Mm hm, mm hm."
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,287.52,289.43,">> Right? So this actually has a name,"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,289.43,292.13,believe it or not. It's actually called locally
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,292.13,294.85,"weighted regression. Yeah, so this actually works pretty"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,294.85,296.77000000000004,well and in place of sort of averaging
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,296.77,299.75,"function, you can do just about anything you want to."
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,299.75,302.46,"You could throw in a decision tree, you could throw in"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,302.46,306.81,"a neural network, you could throw in lines do linear"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,306.81,311.27,"regression. You can do, almost anything that you can imagine doing."
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,311.27,311.44,">> Neat,"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,311.44,314.314,">> Yeah. Add that works out very well. And again, it"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,314.314,316.68,gives you a little bit of power. So here's something I don't
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,316.68,318.98,think is very obvious until it's pointed out to you. Which is
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,318.98,321.98,this notion of replacing the average with a more general regression or
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,321.98,324.93,even classification function. It actually allows
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,324.93,326.57,you to do something more powerful
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,326.57,329.46999999999997,than it seems. So let's imagine that we were going to do locally
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,329.47,333.25,"weighted regression and we were going to do, in fact, linear regression. So,"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,333.25,336.65,"what would locally- weighted linear regression look like? Well, if we go"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,336.65,339.35999999999996,"back to this example over here on the left basically, you take"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,339.36,341.25,all the points that are nearby and you try to fit a
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,341.25,343.68,"line to it. And, so you would end up with stuff that"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,343.68,347.2,"looked, pretty much, like this. While you're over here, you would get"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,347.2,349.03,"the line like this, but while you were over here you'd"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,349.03,351.59,"get a line like this. Then, somewhere in the middle you"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,351.59,354.63,would get lines that started to look like this and And
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,354.63,357.4,you would end up with something that kind of ended up looking
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,357.4,360.71999999999997,a lot like a curve. So that's kind of cool because
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,360.72,364.64000000000004,you notice that we start with a hypothesis state of lines
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,364.64,367.99,and this locally weighted linear regression. But then we end up
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,367.99,374.05,actually being able to represent a hypothesis space that is strictly bigger.
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,374.05,376.57,than the set of lines. Hm. So we can
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,376.57,379.31,use a very simple kind of hypothesis space but by
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,379.31,381.8,using this locally weighted regression we end up with
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,381.8,386.01,"a more complicated space that is complicated, that's made more"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,386.01,389.31,complicated depending upon the complications that are represented by
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,389.31,393.11,"your data points. So this results, this sort of reveals"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,393.11,396.46000000000004,"another bit of power with kNN. Which is, it"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,396.46,399.65,allows you to take local information and build functions or
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,399.65,402.85999999999996,build concepts around the local things that are similar to

_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,405.92,406.77000000000004,>> Neat.
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,406.77,409.79999999999995,">> At least in principle. Okay, cool. Alright so you got all that?"
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,409.8,411.09000000000003,">> I, think so yeah."
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,411.09,413.21999999999997,">> Okay, cool. So then, I think we should wrap up."
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,413.22,414.0,>> Nice.
_GYhs4re3JA,Some Other Stuff - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,414.0,414.81,>> Nice.
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.09,1.859,Okay Michael so I think with that little
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,1.859,5.45,"bit of discussion, I feel like we're done."
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,5.45,8.1,>> Cool! Alright. Well it's been nice talking to you. I hope
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,8.1,11.12,"the course went well and, oh you mean just for this lesson?"
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,11.12,12.329999999999998,>> Yeah just for this lesson.
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,12.33,12.67,>> Alright.
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,12.67,12.85,>> So let's.
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,12.85,13.94,>> Well let's wrap up this lesson then.
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,13.94,15.459999999999999,>> Yeah let's see what have we learned?
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,15.46,17.64,So remind me Michael what have we learned?
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,17.64,20.09,>> Well we were talking about instance based learning.
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,20.09,23.33,>> That's true. That's the first thing we learned. You will notice
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,23.33,25.479999999999997,"by the way, I never actually told you why it was called instance"
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,25.48,25.905,based learning.
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,25.905,28.520000000000003,">> Charles, why is it called instance based learning?"
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,28.52,30.689999999999998,>> I don't know but I am willing to guess that it has to do with a
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,30.69,33.52,fact that we look at the exact instances that
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,33.52,35.59,we have and we base our learning on that.
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,35.59,40.03,>> Alright and we brought it up in
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,40.03,43.160000000000004,by starting off thinking about eager and lazy learning.
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,43.16,45.949999999999996,">> Right. What is the difference, Michael?"
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,45.95,49.77,>> I will tell you when I need to tell you.
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,49.77,51.230000000000004,>> [Laugh]
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,51.23,52.209999999999994,That's exactly right.
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,52.21,55.61,>> So lazy learning is about putting off the work
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,55.61,58.6,"until it's actually needed. Eager is about, as soon as"
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,58.6,61.75,"the problem is posed, solve it. And then, you know,"
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,61.75,65.79,"if you're lucky, the answer will eventually come in handy."
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,65.79,67.75,>> Exactly right. Okay what else?
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,67.75,71.43,>> So as a concrete example of a lazy
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,71.43,75.617,learner we talked about k-nearest neighbor or k-NN.
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,75.617,77.93,>> kNN. And
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,77.93,80.75,this whole notion of nearest neighbor. Is in
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,80.75,86.39,fact one way of talking about similarity functions.
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,86.39,91.24,>> Right and the similarity functions play a really central role in all this.
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,91.24,93.44999999999999,>> Right. Similarity. We talk about it as
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,93.45,95.85000000000001,if they were distance functions. But distance is
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,95.85,99.86999999999999,"just another way of talking about, a similarity."
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,99.87,102.77000000000001,"So, this is actually keeping. K-nn was a specific,"
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,102.77,105.28999999999999,"algorithm we used, and we talked about various versions of it,"
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,105.29,108.05000000000001,"and, the nearest neighbor part really got us to think a"
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,108.05,111.11,"little bit about similarity and distance and, and what all that"
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,111.11,116.6,"means. A really important thing here is, I think, that similarity is"
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,116.6,120.395,just another way of capturing domain knowledge. And K in
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,120.395,122.78,k-NN is another way of capturing domain knowledge. And that
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,122.78,125.54,"if we saw through the quizes and some of our discussions,"
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,125.54,128.479,"that this is actually very, very important. That domain knowledge matters."
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,130.09,133.95000000000002,"Now, we also talked about KNN in the context of both regression and"
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,133.95,139.88,"classification. I see what you did there, 'Knnowledge', it's got KNN in it."
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,139.88,144.26999999999998,">> >Okay, so yeah, classification and regression are different things. But,"
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,144.27,146.41,"KNN can handle both of them. And, at the end of the"
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,146.41,150.71,"day, that's all stuck in our notion of similarity, and our"
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,150.71,156.41,"notion of averaging. Which we kind of took as an overall term,"
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,156.41,160.0,"for a bunch of different things you might do, which some people find confusing."
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,160.0,160.322,>> [LAUGH].
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,160.322,161.95,>> But I think that other people
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,161.95,163.39,would really kind of understand what we mean.
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,163.39,165.23999999999998,>> I'm very tempted to take that out of
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,165.24,167.77,"Wikipedia, but that would, that would just be rude."
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,167.77,171.96,>> It would be rude. Anything else? We learned one big thing.
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,171.96,175.57000000000002,>> We looked at how to compose different learning algorithms
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,175.57,179.12,together. For example in the context of locally weighted linear regression.
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,179.12,179.268,>> Mm hm.
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,179.268,181.68,>> We used this instance based idea
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,181.68,185.01000000000002,along with linear regression to get something
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,185.01,188.62,that was both locally smooth but globally bumpy.
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,188.62,191.32,">> Right. So, I'm going to just say"
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,191.32,193.97,locally weighted regression. Where we can do any kind
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,193.97,196.59,of regression we might want to. I was going to
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,196.59,199.18,"call that $X. So, stick in your favorite value."
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,200.51,202.28,">> Let's see, what else? Oh, oh, a"
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,202.28,204.52,really big thing was Bellman's curse of dimensionality.
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,204.52,205.48000000000002,>> Yes.
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,205.48,207.11999999999998,>> And
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,207.12,210.21,the idea there was that the more features that you
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,210.21,214.03,include The more data you need to fill up that space.
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,214.03,217.44,">> Yep, It's exponential."
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,217.44,222.23,>> And in fact I even just I decided to go and play with this a little
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,222.23,223.57999999999998,bit so that example that you were doing
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,223.58,227.11,before where the y equals x1 squared plus x2
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,227.11,228.45000000000002,>> Mm-hm.
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,228.45,232.35999999999999,>> When I gave it well as we saw in the example we gave it like ten or 12
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,232.36,236.70000000000002,examples and it did really badly. So it continued to do somewhat badly until
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,236.7,239.79999999999998,"I got to about 100,000 and then it was actually doing [LAUGH] really well."
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,239.8,240.54000000000002,>> Hmm.
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,240.54,242.14,>> But that seems like an awful lot of
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,242.14,244.48,examples for what is otherwise a very simple problem.
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,244.48,247.28,">> Right. Well if you think about it, the"
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,247.28,249.88,amount of data you have to see to determine
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,249.88,253.68,the relative. Relevance of the two different dimensions is
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,253.68,255.33,quite a bit in that particular kind of function.
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,255.33,256.18,>> Hm.
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,256.18,257.42,>> Yeah. That's a lot
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,257.42,259.815,of space to cover. All possible real
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,259.815,264.01,values [LAUGH] across a potentially infinite space.
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,264.01,266.81,">> Yeah, I guess that's true."
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,266.81,269.29,">> Yeah, so the cursor dimensionality is real and we"
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,269.29,272.67,just sort of can't get around it. Although As I mentioned
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,272.67,276.0,earlier we will see in the second part of the
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,276.0,279.25,course ways that people try to get around the curse of dimensionality.
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,279.25,280.3,>> Ahah!
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,280.3,282.12,>> Mm-hm. Okay.
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,282.12,282.56,>> Or at least
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,282.56,283.24,blunt it. Right?
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,283.24,284.59000000000003,>> Yeah or at least blunt it because you can't
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,284.59,287.82,"actually get around the curse of dimensionality, you can only deal with it."
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,287.82,290.87,>> There is no free lunch.

sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,294.48,295.48,>> What's the theorem?
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,295.48,301.65000000000003,>> No free lunch. That any learning algorithm that you create
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,301.65,307.53,"is going to have the property; that if you average over all possible instances,"
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,307.53,309.08,it's not doing any different than random.
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,309.08,311.55,">> Right. And, and another way of thinking about"
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,311.55,313.48,"that, a practical way of thinking about that is;"

sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,329.7,332.82,">> So does that mean that, that all of machine learning really comes down to,"
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,332.82,334.79,you have to already know what you need to solve

sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,354.89,357.9,of technique or this kind of technique? Is K-nn a sort of
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,357.9,360.34,better way of approaching it? Decision tree a better way
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,360.34,362.73999999999995,"of approaching it? Um,It's a lot of what this class is"
sCB2j73jzbo,What Have We Learned - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,362.74,365.84000000000003,about. Is helping them to get enough domain knowledge or enough

w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,14.01,18.65,a class of algorithms called ensemble learners. And I think you will See
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,18.65,21.31,"that they're related to some of the stuff that we've been doing already,"
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,21.31,24.7,"and in particular we're going to spend most of our time focusing on, boosting."
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,25.85,27.35,because boosting is my favorite of the

w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,35.79,38.839999999999996,to think about a problem. Okay. And the particular
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,38.84,41.980000000000004,"problem I want you to think about is, spam email."
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,41.98,44.43,">> Mm, I think about that a lot."
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,44.43,47.98,">> So, normally if we were thinking of this a classification"
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,47.98,51.04,"task, right, where we're going to take some email and we're going to decide"
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,51.04,53.78,if it's spam or not. Given what we've talked about so
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,53.78,57.59,far we would be thinking about using a decision tree or
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,57.59,61.53,you know neural networks or kNN whatever that means
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,61.53,63.4,with email. We would be coming up with all of these sort
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,63.4,66.33,of complicated things. I want to propose an alternative which is
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,66.33,69.74,going to get us to ensemble learn. OK and here's the alternative.
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,69.74,72.82,I don't want you to try to think of some complicated
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,72.82,76.36,Rule that you might come up with that would capture spam email.
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,76.36,79.42,"Instead, I want you to come up with some simple rules"
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,79.42,81.81,"that are indicative of spam email. Okay, so let me be"
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,81.81,85.27,"specific, Michael. We have this problem with spam email. That is,"
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,85.27,88.91,you you're going to get some email message and you want some computer
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,88.91,92.17,program To figure out automatically for you if something is a
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,92.17,95.35000000000001,piece of spam or it isn't. And I want you to help
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,95.35,98.25999999999999,write a set of rules that'll help me to figure that
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,98.26,101.71000000000001,"out. And I want you to think about simple rules, so can"
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,101.71,105.08,you think of any simple rules that might indicate that something is spam?
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,105.08,107.64999999999999,">> Alright I can, yeah I can think of some simple rules. I don't think"
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,107.65,115.31,"they would be very good, but they might better than nothing. Like If for example"
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,115.31,119.83,"it mentions how manly I am, I, I would be, be willing to believe that"
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,119.83,123.78,was a spam message. So like if the body of the message contains the word manly.
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,123.78,127.69,">> Okay, I like that. like that when body"
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,127.69,129.49,contains manly.
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,131.97,135.98,"I like that rule, because I often get non-spam messages talking about"
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,135.98,139.26,manly. So I guess one man's spam is another man's normal email.
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,139.26,141.31,>> [LAUGH] I guess that's true.
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,141.31,143.59,>> Probably. Any other rules?
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,143.59,147.74,">> Sure if it, you know if it comes from my spouse it's probably not spam."
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,147.74,151.07000000000002,">> OK, so let's see, from spouse."
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,151.07,154.65,>> Her name's Lisa. Now we're going to call our spouse. So
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,154.65,157.08,"let's say minus, I'm going to go to plus here, so we know"
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,157.08,159.61,"some rules are indicitive of being spam, and some"
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,159.61,162.25,"rules are indicitive of not being spam. Okay, anything else?"
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,163.35,168.534,>> Possibly the length of the message. I guess. Like what?
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,168.534,170.09,>> I don't know. I don't know that this would be very

w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,174.84,178.48,"URL. Like hey, check out this site, and then there's a URL."
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,178.48,182.76999999999998,">> Hm, I like that. So, we'll just say short."
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,182.77,186.07000000000002,"Just contains URLs. Hm, I like those rules. Let's see if we can"
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,186.07,189.29,"think of anything else. Oh, how about this one. It's just an image."
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,189.29,190.57999999999998,>> Hm.
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,190.58,193.19000000000003,>> I get a lot of those where it's just an image.
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,193.19,195.51,">> I see, like in it's it's and if you"
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,195.51,198.13,look at the picture it's all various pharmaceuticals from Canada.
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,198.13,200.5,>> Exactly. Here's one I get a lot.
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,200.5,201.84,">> Hm,"
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,201.84,208.87,>> Lots of misspelled words that you end up reading as being
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,208.87,209.54,a real word.
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,209.54,211.85,>> Hm. But I don't know how I'd write that
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,211.85,214.38,as a rule. Or you could just list the words.
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,214.38,216.93,">> Like rules that, words that have already"
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,216.93,219.32,been modified in that way. I guess so.
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,219.32,221.57,">> Yeah, kind of a, kind of a black list, a black list of words."
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,221.57,225.95999999999998,">> Okay so, words like, I would say manly, but you were saying prawn."
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,225.96,229.11,">> Or whatever that says. yeah, so they're and they're tons"
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,229.11,231.45000000000002,"of these. Right? I mean, another one that's, that's very popular"
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,233.53,236.61,"if you're old enough anyway is this one, remember this one?"
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,236.61,240.20000000000002,">> Oh, sure that was sometimes a virus, right?"
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,240.2,244.89999999999998,">> Yes. Our young, our younger viewers will not know this but this was one"
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,244.9,247.67000000000002,of the first big spam messages that would
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,247.67,249.91,get out there. Make money fast. And there's
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,249.91,253.92,"tons and tons of these. We could come up with a bunch of them. Now, here's"
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,253.92,255.32999999999998,"something they all kind of have in common,"
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,255.33,258.64,"Michael, and you've touched on this all ready."
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,258.64,263.93,All of them are sort of right. They're useful but no one of them is going to be
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,263.93,267.34000000000003,very good at telling us whether a message has
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,267.34,271.36999999999995,spam on its own. Right. So the word manly is
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,271.37,273.93,evidence but it's not enough to decide whether something
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,273.93,277.19,"is spam or not. It's from your spouse, it's evidence"
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,277.19,281.39,"it's not spam, but sometimes you get messages from"
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,281.39,283.68,"your spouse that are in fact spam, because in fact,"
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,283.68,286.21,"she didn't actually send them. You know, and so"
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,286.21,288.31,on and so forth. And sometimes she did email
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,288.31,291.67,from Princes in Nigeria. I didn't. And they're not
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,291.67,295.2,"always spam. I, I actually do, but any case,"
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,295.2,296.88,"sometimes people are asking you for money, and maybe"
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,296.88,298.25,"that's message you want to ignore, but it isn't"
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,298.25,302.14,necessarily spam. And some people are very interested in
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,302.14,304.96999999999997,"getting like this and don't consider it spam, right?"
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,304.97,308.88000000000005,">> So, so, okay, so I can see that these would"
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,308.88,312.3,"all maybe provide some evidence, but it seems really hard tp figure out the"
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,312.3,315.29,"right way of combining them all together to I don't know, make a decision."
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,315.29,316.70000000000005,">> Right, this is exactly right. And by the"
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,316.7,318.76,"way, if you think about something like decision tree, you"
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,318.76,320.98,could. There's really a sort of similar problem going on
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,320.98,322.68,there. We can think of each of the nodes in
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,322.68,325.21,a decision tree as being a very simple rule and
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,325.21,327.84,the decision tree tells us how to combine them. Right?
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,327.84,329.54999999999995,"So, we need to figure out how to do that"
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,329.55,334.2,here and that is the fundamental notion of ensemble learning.
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,334.2,336.62,">> But wait, isn't, couldn't you also do something similar with"
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,336.62,339.68,something like neural net. Right? Where each of these now becomes a
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,339.68,341.97,feature and we're just trying to learn weights for combining them
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,341.97,344.77000000000004,all together. So That would kind of satisfy what you were talking about.
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,344.77,348.04999999999995,">> True, I mean I think the the difference here in this case and"
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,348.05,349.64,and I think you're absolutely right but
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,349.64,351.28,one difference here is that typically with the
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,351.28,354.03999999999996,new network we've already built the network
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,354.04,355.57,itself and the nodes and we're trying
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,355.57,357.48,to learn the weights whereas in something
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,357.48,359.37,like a decision tree you're building up rules
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,359.37,363.05,as you go along. And typically with ensemble learning you're building up a
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,363.05,365.88,bunch of rules and combining them together until you got something that's good
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,365.88,367.32,enough. But you're absolutely right. You
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,367.32,369.17,could think of neural networks as being
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,369.17,372.18,an ensemble of little parts. Sometimes
w75WyRjRpAg,Ensemble Learning Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,372.18,374.13,"hard to understand, but an ensemble nonetheless."
ZIf4I297fH8,Ensemble Learning Simple Rules - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.008,3.33,"So, the characteristic of ensemble learning is first this, that"
ZIf4I297fH8,Ensemble Learning Simple Rules - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,3.33,5.82,"you take a bunch of simple rules, all of which kind"
ZIf4I297fH8,Ensemble Learning Simple Rules - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,5.82,9.4,of make sense and you can see as sort of helping.
ZIf4I297fH8,Ensemble Learning Simple Rules - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,9.4,11.47,"But on their own, individually, do not give you a good"
ZIf4I297fH8,Ensemble Learning Simple Rules - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,11.47,14.83,answer. And then you magically combine them in some way to
ZIf4I297fH8,Ensemble Learning Simple Rules - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,14.83,17.62,"create a more complex rule, that in fact, works really well."
ZIf4I297fH8,Ensemble Learning Simple Rules - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,18.68,22.45,And ensemble learning algorithms have a sort of basic form to
ZIf4I297fH8,Ensemble Learning Simple Rules - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,22.45,25.099999999999998,"them, that can be described in just one or two lines."
ZIf4I297fH8,Ensemble Learning Simple Rules - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,25.1,27.520000000000003,So let me do that and then we can start wondering a little bit
ZIf4I297fH8,Ensemble Learning Simple Rules - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,27.52,30.37,how we're going to make that real. So here's the basic form of an ensemble
ZIf4I297fH8,Ensemble Learning Simple Rules - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,30.37,32.689,learning algorithm. Basically you learn over a
ZIf4I297fH8,Ensemble Learning Simple Rules - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,32.689,34.69,"subset of the data, and that generates"
ZIf4I297fH8,Ensemble Learning Simple Rules - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,34.69,37.4,some kind of a rule. And then you learn over another subset of the data
ZIf4I297fH8,Ensemble Learning Simple Rules - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,37.4,40.5,and that generates a different rule. And then you learn over another subset of
ZIf4I297fH8,Ensemble Learning Simple Rules - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,40.5,43.19,"the data and that generates yet a third rule, and yet a fourth rule, and"
ZIf4I297fH8,Ensemble Learning Simple Rules - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,43.19,45.76,"yet a fifth rule, and so on and so forth. And then eventually you"
ZIf4I297fH8,Ensemble Learning Simple Rules - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,45.76,50.489999999999995,take all of those rules and you combine them into one of these complex rules.
ZIf4I297fH8,Ensemble Learning Simple Rules - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,50.49,53.92,"So, we might imagine in the email case that I might"
ZIf4I297fH8,Ensemble Learning Simple Rules - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,53.92,57.31,look at a small subset of email that I know is already
ZIf4I297fH8,Ensemble Learning Simple Rules - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,57.31,60.0,spam and discover that the word manly shows up in all of
ZIf4I297fH8,Ensemble Learning Simple Rules - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,60.0,63.66,them and therefore pick that up as a rule. That's going to be
ZIf4I297fH8,Ensemble Learning Simple Rules - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,63.66,66.78999999999999,"good at that subset of mail, but not necessarily be good"
ZIf4I297fH8,Ensemble Learning Simple Rules - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,66.79,69.35000000000001,at the other subset of mail. And do the same thing and
ZIf4I297fH8,Ensemble Learning Simple Rules - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,69.35,72.5,discover that a lot of the spam mails are in fact short
ZIf4I297fH8,Ensemble Learning Simple Rules - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,72.5,75.97,or a lot of them are just images or just urls and
ZIf4I297fH8,Ensemble Learning Simple Rules - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,75.97,77.53,so on and so forth. And that's how I
ZIf4I297fH8,Ensemble Learning Simple Rules - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,77.53,80.55,learn these rules by looking at different subsets. Which
ZIf4I297fH8,Ensemble Learning Simple Rules - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,80.55,83.63,"is why you end up with rules that are very good at a small set of the data, but"
ZIf4I297fH8,Ensemble Learning Simple Rules - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,83.63,85.71,aren't necessarily good at a large set of the
ZIf4I297fH8,Ensemble Learning Simple Rules - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,85.71,88.41,"data. And then after you've collected these rules, you combine"
ZIf4I297fH8,Ensemble Learning Simple Rules - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,88.41,90.32,"them in some way, and there you go. And"
ZIf4I297fH8,Ensemble Learning Simple Rules - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,90.32,93.08,that's really the beginning and the end of ensemble learning.
ZIf4I297fH8,Ensemble Learning Simple Rules - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,93.08,97.74,">> So wait. So, when you say manly was in a lot of the positive"
ZIf4I297fH8,Ensemble Learning Simple Rules - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,97.74,99.36999999999999,examples. Do you mean like it distinguishes the
ZIf4I297fH8,Ensemble Learning Simple Rules - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,99.37,101.04,positive and the negative example? So it should
ZIf4I297fH8,Ensemble Learning Simple Rules - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,101.04,102.74000000000001,also not be in the negative examples.
ZIf4I297fH8,Ensemble Learning Simple Rules - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,102.74,104.83999999999999,>> That's right. That's exactly right. So think of
ZIf4I297fH8,Ensemble Learning Simple Rules - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,104.84,107.36,this as any other classification learning problem that you
ZIf4I297fH8,Ensemble Learning Simple Rules - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,107.36,108.66,would have where you're trying to come up with
ZIf4I297fH8,Ensemble Learning Simple Rules - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,108.66,110.869,some way to distinguish between the positives and the negatives.
ZIf4I297fH8,Ensemble Learning Simple Rules - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,110.869,113.89,">> And, and now why does it, why are we are looking at subsets of"

Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,91.57,93.00999999999999,">> Oh, yeah, sure."
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,93.01,95.80000000000001,">> So here's what you get, Michael. Here I'm showing you a plot over"
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,95.8,98.39999999999999,"those same points, with the five different"
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,98.4,101.0,3rd order polynomials. Can you see them?
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,101.0,104.68,">> Yeah. They're, right. There's like a bunch of wispy hairs."
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,104.68,107.32000000000001,>> Just like most third order polynomials. And as
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,107.32,109.02,"you can see they're, they're kind of you stare at"
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,109.02,111.69,them and you see their kind of similar. But
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,111.69,114.3,some of them they veer off a little bit because
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,114.3,116.91,they're looking at different data points. One of them
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,116.91,118.97999999999999,actually very hard to see because it's only one like
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,118.98,122.92,"this. Actually veers off like this because just, purely"
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,122.92,125.85000000000001,"randomly, it never got to see the two final points."
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,125.85,126.44999999999999,>> I see.
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,126.45,128.74,"But they all, but they all seem to be pretty much in"
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,128.74,130.46,"agreement, like between points three and"
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,130.46,132.36,four. There's a lot of consistency there.
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,132.36,134.14000000000001,>> Right. Because just picking five of the
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,134.14,136.27999999999997,subsets you seem to be able to either get
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,136.28,137.78,"things on the end, or you get things in"
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,137.78,139.95,the middle. And maybe one or two things on
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,139.95,141.19,the end it sort of works out. Even the
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,141.19,144.89,"one that doesn't see the, the last two points"
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,144.89,146.57999999999998,still got to see a bunch of first ones
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,146.58,149.76000000000002,and get this part of this space fairly right.
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,149.76,150.59,>> Cool.
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,150.59,151.31,>> Okay.
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,151.31,154.67000000000002,So the question now becomes how good is
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,154.67,156.80999999999997,the average of these compared to something we might
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,156.81,159.76,have learned over the entire data set? And here's
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,159.76,162.96099999999998,what we get when do that. So what you're
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,162.961,166.354,"looking at now Michael, is the red line,"
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,166.354,169.573,is the average of all of those five third
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,169.573,173.342,"order polynomials. And the blue line, is the fourth"
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,173.342,176.54000000000002,order polynomial that we learned when we did this
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,176.54,180.295,"with simple regression, a couple of lessons back."
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,180.295,180.315,>> Okay.
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,180.315,182.38,>> And you actually see them pretty close.
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,182.38,185.26,">> Why is one of them a fourth order, and one a third order?"
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,185.26,189.14,">> Well what I wanted to do is try a simpler set of hypothesis,"
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,189.14,192.04999999999998,"than we were doing, than when we were doing full blown regression. So third"
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,192.05,196.5,"order simpler than fourth order. So, I thought we'd combine a bunch of simpler"
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,196.5,199.94,rules. Then the one we had used before and see how well it does.
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,199.94,200.85,>> You want to know how well it does?
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,200.85,201.7,>> I would!
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,201.7,204.67999999999998,>> Well it turns out that on this data
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,204.68,206.63,"set and I did this many, many, many times"
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,206.63,208.47,just to see what would happen with many different
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,208.47,211.55,random subsets. It typically is the case that the
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,211.55,214.24,"blue line always does better on the training set,"
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,214.24,217.32000000000002,"the red points, than the red line does. But"
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,217.32,219.79,the red line almost always does better on the
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,219.79,222.48999999999998,green point on the test set or the validation set.
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,222.49,223.51000000000002,>> Interesting.
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,223.51,226.94,">> That is kind of interesting. So wait, so let me get this straight."
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,226.94,230.69,"It seems sort of magical. So, so it learns an average"
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,230.69,234.71,"of third degree polynomials, third order polynomials, which is itself a"
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,234.71,238.46,third order polynomial. But you're saying it does better by doing
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,238.46,243.32000000000002,this kind of trick than just learning a third order polynomial directly.
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,243.32,245.18,">> Yeah, why might you think that might be?"
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,246.47,248.42,"I have a guess, you tell me what you think."
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,248.42,252.04999999999998,">> Wow, so well, I mean, you know, the danger is often"
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,252.05,256.829,"over fitting, over fitting is like the scary possibility. And so maybe"
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,256.829,260.93,"by, by kind of mixing the data up in this way and focusing"
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,260.93,264.33,on different subsets of it. I don't know. Somehow manages to find the
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,264.33,266.16999999999996,important structure as opposed to getting
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,266.17,268.02000000000004,misled by any of the individual datapoints.
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,268.02,269.64,>> Yeah. That's the basic idea. It's kind of the
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,269.64,271.88,"same thing, at least that's what I, I think that's"
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,271.88,274.65,a good answer. It's basically the same kind of argument
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,274.65,277.08,you make for cross validation. Alright. You take a random
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,277.08,282.44,bunch of subsets. You don't get trapped by one or two points that happen to
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,282.44,284.29,be wrong because they happen to be wrong
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,284.29,286.09000000000003,because of noise or whatever. And you sort
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,286.09,288.17999999999995,of average out all of the variances and
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,288.18,291.14,the differences. Hm. And often times it works.
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,291.14,295.18,And in practice this particular technique of ensemble learning
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,295.18,298.15000000000003,does quite well in getting rid of overfitting.
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,298.15,299.67999999999995,>> And what is this called?
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,299.68,302.23,">> So, this particular version, where you take"
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,302.23,306.32,"a random subset and you combine by the mean, it's called bagging."
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,306.32,309.34999999999997,>> And I guess the bags are the random subsets?
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,309.35,309.93,>> Sure.
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,309.93,312.63,>> [LAUGH]
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,312.63,313.61,That's how I'm going to think of it.
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,313.61,315.94,>> That's how I'm going to think of it. It also has another name
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,315.94,319.88,which is called bootstrap aggregation. So I
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,319.88,321.9,guess the different subsets are the boots.
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,321.9,324.52,">> [LAUGH] No,no, no, no bootstrap usually"
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,324.52,327.07,refers to pulling yourself up by your bootstraps.
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,327.07,327.9,">> Yeah, I"
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,327.9,330.72999999999996,"like my, I like my answer better. So, each of the subsets"
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,330.73,334.12,are the boots and the averaging is the strap. And there you go.
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,334.12,337.25,"So, regardless of whether you call it bootstrap aggregation or you call it"
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,337.25,340.89,"bagging, you'll notice it's not what I said we were going to talk about"
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,340.89,345.22999999999996,during today's discussion. I said we were going to talk about boosting. So we're
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,345.23,346.38,talking about bagging but we're going to
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,346.38,348.02,talk about boosting. The reason I wanted
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,348.02,350.46,to talk about bagging is because it's really the simplest thing you can
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,350.46,353.01,think of and it actually works remarkably well. But there are a couple
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,353.01,354.49,"of things that are wrong with it, or a couple"
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,354.49,358.07,of things you might imagine you might do better. That
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,358.07,360.8,might address some of the issues and we're going to see
Cn7StaXU_8o,Ensemble Learning An Example - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,360.8,363.63,all of those when we talk about boosting right now.
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.61,3.76,"Okay so, let's go back and look at our two"
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,3.76,6.609999999999999,questions we were trying to answer. And so far we've
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,6.61,9.56,"answer the first one, learn over a subset of data,"
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,9.56,13.530000000000001,defined a rule by choosing that subset uniformally randomly and
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,13.53,16.53,"applying some learning algorithm. And we answered the second question,"
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,16.53,18.830000000000002,which is how do you combine all of those rules
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,18.83,21.759999999999998,"of thumbs by saying, you simply average them. And that"
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,21.76,26.68,"gave us, bagging. So Michael, I'm going to suggest an alternative"
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,26.68,29.43,to at least the first one. And leave open the
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,29.43,31.78,second one for a moment. That's going to get us
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,31.78,34.13,"to what we're supposed to be talking about today, which"
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,34.13,36.57,is boosting. So let me throw and idea at you and
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,36.57,38.05,you tell me if you think it's a good one.
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,38.05,43.43,"So rather than choosing uniformly randomly. Over the data, we should"
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,43.43,46.49,try to take advantage of what we are learning as
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,46.49,51.52,"we go along, and instead of focusing just kind of randomly,"
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,51.52,56.92,we should pick the examples that we are not good at.
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,56.92,58.5,So what do i mean by that? What i mean by that
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,58.5,64.349,is. We should pick a subset based upon whether the examples
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,64.349,68.08,in that subset are hard. So what do you think of that?
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,68.08,71.75,">> Well, I guess it depends on how we think about hard, right"
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,71.75,76.47,"so it could be that it's hard because some, in some absolute sense right,"
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,76.47,79.19,"or could be that it is hard relative to you know, if we"
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,79.19,82.34,"were to stop now how well we do Yeah, and I mean the latter."
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,82.34,84.43,>> Oh. Okay. Alright. Well that I feel like
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,84.43,86.64,"that makes a lot of sense. I mean, certainly when"
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,86.64,89.65,"I'm you know, trying to learn a new skill,"
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,89.65,91.69000000000001,I'll spend most of my energy on the stuff that
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,91.69,93.49,"I kind, that I'm kind of on the edge of"
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,93.49,95.41,"being able to do, not the stuff that I've already"
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,95.41,98.36,"mastered. It can be a little dispiriting. But it, but"
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,98.36,100.23,"it I think it, I make faster progress that way."
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,100.23,101.49000000000001,">> Right and if you, if you go"
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,101.49,105.08999999999999,"back to the example that we, we started with, with spam right?"
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,105.09,107.32000000000001,If you come up with a and you see it does a
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,107.32,110.49,"very good on some of the data, some of the mail examples,"
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,110.49,113.14,but doesn't do a good job on the other. Why would you spend
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,113.14,116.6,your time trying to come up with more rules that do well
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,116.6,119.38,on the email messages you already know how to classify? You should
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,119.38,121.97,be focusing on the ones you don't know how to classify. And
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,121.97,126.61,"that's the basic idea here between, the basic idea here behind boosting and"
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,126.61,128.0,finding the hardest examples.
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,128.0,128.68,>> Cool.
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,128.68,131.52,>> Okay. So that answers the first one. We're going to
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,131.52,133.48000000000002,"look at the hardest examples, and I'm going to define for"
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,133.48,135.97,you exactly what that means. I'm going to have to introduce
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,135.97,138.71,"at least one technical definition. But ,uh, I want to make"
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,138.71,141.24,"certain you got that. And the second one, the combining,"
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,141.24,144.04000000000002,"well that's a difficult and sort of complicated thing, but"
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,144.04,146.35,"at a high level, I can explain it pretty easily"
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,146.35,148.18,by saying we are going to still stick with the mean.
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,148.18,149.41,>> Okay.
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,149.41,152.07999999999998,">> We're voting except this time,this time we"
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,152.08,155.05,are going to do weighted mean. Now why do we want to do
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,155.05,157.36,weighted mean? Well I have to tell you exactly how we are going to

_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,167.24,170.99,average or a constant that doesn't give you a lot of information about the
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,170.99,174.28,"space. So we're going to weight it by something, and it's going to turn"
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,174.28,177.12,out the way we choose to weight it will be very important. But just
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,177.12,178.68,keep in your head for now that we're going to try to
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,178.68,181.8,do some sort of weighted average. Some kind of weighted voting. Okay?
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,181.8,185.63000000000002,">> Sure. One of the things that's scaring me at the moment though is this,"
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,185.63,188.41,like I have this fear that by focusing
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,188.41,190.19,"on the hardest questions, and then, and then"
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,190.19,192.46,"sort of mastering those, what's to keep the"
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,192.46,194.89000000000001,learner from starting to kind of lose track of
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,194.89,197.04,"the ones it has already mastered? Like how,"
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,197.04,198.6,why does it not thrash back and forth?
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,198.6,202.16,">> So that's going to be the trick. Behind the,"
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,202.16,203.545,the particular way that we do weighting.
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,203.545,204.01299999999998,>> Okay
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,204.013,206.48000000000002,">> So I will show you that in a moment, and it's going to require"

_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,209.31,212.06,"been kind of skirting around, this entire conversation. Okay?"
_Z8uJgg92ew,Ensemble Boosting - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,212.06,212.74,>> Sure.
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,1.0,2.96,"Alright so, the, the whole goal of what we're"
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,2.96,4.76,"going to add for boosting here is we're going to, we're going to"
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,4.76,7.4,expand on this notion of hardest examples and weighted
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,7.4,9.790000000000001,"mean. But before I can do that, I'm going to have"
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,9.79,11.77,to define a couple of terms. Okay. And you
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,11.77,14.459999999999999,"let me know Michael if, if these terms make sense."
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,14.46,17.79,"So, here's the first one. The first one is"
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,17.79,21.57,error. So how have we been defining error so far?
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,21.57,26.37,>> Usually we take the square difference between the
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,26.37,29.42,"correct labels and the, what's produced"
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,29.42,31.650000000000002,by our classifier or regression algorithm.
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,31.65,32.93,>> That's true. That is how we've been using
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,32.93,36.019999999999996,"error when we're thinking about regression error. How about, a"
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,36.02,39.5,"notion of accuracy. About how good we are at,"
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,39.5,43.1,"say, classifying examples. So let's, let's stick with classification formulas."
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,43.1,44.74,">> Well, that would be the same as"
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,44.74,47.27,"squared areas, except that it's not really meeting the"
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,47.27,49.07,"whole powers [INAUDIBLE] area. That is to say, if"
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,49.07,51.79,"the outputs are zeroes and ones, the squared area"
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,51.79,53.62,is just whether or not there's a mismatch. So
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,53.62,56.62,it could just be the total number of wrong answers.
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,56.62,57.72,">> Right. So, what we've been doing so"
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,57.72,60.43,"far is counting mismatches. I like that word, mismatches."
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,60.43,62.21,And we might call an error raid or
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,62.21,65.61,an error percentage as the total number of mismatches
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,65.61,67.92,over the total number of examples. And that
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,67.92,71.37,"tells us whether we're at 85% or 92%, or,"
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,71.37,73.10000000000001,"or whatever, right? So that's what we've been doing"
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,73.1,76.82,"so far. But implicit in that, Michael, is the"
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,76.82,80.6,idea that every single example is equally as important.
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,80.6,83.89999999999999,"So, that's not always the case. Now you might remember"
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,83.9,87.13000000000001,from the first talk that we had. We talked
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,87.13,91.25,"about distributions over examples. We said that, you know, learning"
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,91.25,93.53,only happens if you're training set has the same
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,93.53,97.33,"distribution as your future testing set. And if it doesn't,"
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,97.33,98.98,then all bets are off. And it's very difficult
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,98.98,102.39,to talk about induction or learning. That notion of distribution
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,102.39,104.85,"is implicit in everything that we've been doing so far, and"
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,104.85,107.41,we haven't really been taking into account when we've been talking
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,107.41,110.32,about error. So here's another definition of error and you tell
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,110.32,111.85,"me if you think it makes sense, given what we just"
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,111.85,115.69999999999999,"said. So, this is my definition of error. So the subscript"
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,115.7,120.51,"D, stands for distribution. So we don't know how new examples"
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,120.51,123.09,"are being drawn, but however they're being drawn they're being drawn"
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,123.09,126.3,"from some distribution, and I'm just going to call that distribution"" D"", okay?"
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,126.3,126.86,>> mhm
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,126.86,129.639,Right. So H is our old friend the
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,129.639,132.58,hypothesis. That's the specific hypothesis that our learner
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,132.58,134.97,has output. That's what we think is the
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,134.97,138.25,"true concept, and C is whatever the true underlying"
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,138.25,141.77,concept is. So I'm going to define error as
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,141.77,145.74,"the probability, given the underlined distribution that I"
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,145.74,148.8,will disagree with the true concept on some
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,148.8,151.59,particular instance X. Does that make sense for you?
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,151.59,152.26,>> Yeah
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,152.26,155.25,but I'm not seeing why that's different from number of mismatches in the
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,155.25,159.75,"sense that if we count mismatches on a sample drawn from D, which is"
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,159.75,162.66,how we would get our testing set anyway. Then I would think that would
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,162.66,166.34,be you know if it's large enough a pretty good approximation of this value.
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,166.34,168.59,">> So here Michael, let me give you a specific example."
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,168.59,172.36,"I'm going to draw four, four possible values of X. And when"
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,172.36,174.66000000000003,"I say I'm going to draw four possible values of X, I"
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,174.66,176.32999999999998,mean I'm just going to put four dots on the the screen.
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,176.33,176.94000000000003,>> Hm.
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,176.94,178.07,>> Okay? And
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,178.07,183.39,then I'm going to tell you this particular learner output a hypothesis.
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,183.39,186.75,"Output you know, a, a potential function that ends up getting"
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,186.75,189.75,"the first one and the third one right, but gets the"
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,189.75,192.6,second and the fourth one wrong. So what's the error here?
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,192.6,193.31,>> Mm.
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,193.31,196.27,">> So let's just make sure that, that"
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,196.27,198.02,everybody's with us. Let's do this as a quiz.
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,198.02,200.33,">> Okay, so let's ask the students what they"
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,200.33,203.62,think. So here's the question again. You've output some hypothesis
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,203.62,207.27,"over the four possible values of x, and it turns"
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,207.27,209.58,"out that you get the first and the third one right,"
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,209.58,212.17000000000002,and you get the second and the fourth one wrong.
zC2rgxxf4dQ,Ensemble Boosting Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,212.17,214.32999999999998,"If I look at it like this, what's the error rate?"
pwMBWEulh48,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.15,1.19,"Okay, Michael what's your answer?"
pwMBWEulh48,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,2.469,5.33,">> It looks like, half of them are right and half of them are"
pwMBWEulh48,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,5.33,9.43,"wrong. So, the number of mismatches, is, two out of four or a half."
pwMBWEulh48,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,9.43,10.62,">> Right, that is exactly the right"
pwMBWEulh48,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,10.62,12.139999999999999,"answer ,because ,you got half of them right"
pwMBWEulh48,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,12.14,15.760000000000002,"and half of them wrong. But ,it assumes ,that your likely to see all four of"
pwMBWEulh48,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,15.76,21.05,"the examples, equally often. So, what if I told you, that, that's not in fact"
pwMBWEulh48,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,21.05,25.450000000000003,"the case. So ,here's another example of error for you. What if I told you that"
pwMBWEulh48,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,25.45,29.07,"each of the points, is, likely to be seen ,uh,"
pwMBWEulh48,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,29.07,32.398,in different proportions and in fact in these particular proportions.
pwMBWEulh48,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,32.398,35.02,"So you're going to see the first one ,half the time."
pwMBWEulh48,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,35.02,37.790000000000006,"You're going to see the second one ,one 20th at"
pwMBWEulh48,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,37.79,40.964999999999996,"a time. You're also going to see the fourth one, one"
pwMBWEulh48,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,40.965,43.376000000000005,20th at a time and you'll see the third one
pwMBWEulh48,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,43.376,45.15,",four tenths of the time. Alright, so you got it"
pwMBWEulh48,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,45.15,47.43,"Michael? One half, one 20th, four tenths and one twentieth."
pwMBWEulh48,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,47.43,47.89,>> Got it.
JFEvpcYooTE,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.2,2.9690000000000003,"Okay. So, now I have a different question for you. Actually, I have"
JFEvpcYooTE,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,2.969,6.8,"the same question for you, which is, what is the error rate now. Go."
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.23,1.27,"Okay, Michael what's the answer?"
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,1.27,5.0600000000000005,">> Well, it's still a half. But I guess we, we really should"
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,5.06,7.24,take into consideration those probability. So
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,7.24,8.46,"the number of mismatches they have, but"
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,8.46,12.600000000000001,"the actual number of errors, the expected number of errors is like well,"
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,12.6,17.956,"a 20th plus 20th, so like a 10th. So it's 90% correct, 10% error."
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,17.956,21.6,">> Right. That's exactly right, so, what's important to see here"
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,21.6,25.270000000000003,"is that even though you may get many examples wrong, in some"
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,25.27,28.61,sense some examples are more important than others. Because
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,28.61,31.24,"some are very rare. And if you think of error,"
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,31.24,33.57,"or the sort of mistakes that you're making, not as"
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,33.57,37.0,"the number of distinct mistakes you can make, but rather"
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,37.0,40.01,"the amount of time you will be wrong, or the"
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,40.01,42.269999999999996,"amount of time you'll make a mistake, then you can"
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,42.27,44.150000000000006,begin to see that it's important to think about the
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,44.15,47.339999999999996,underlying distribution of examples that. You see. You buy that?
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,47.34,47.71,>> Yeah.
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,47.71,50.44,">> Okay, so, that notion of error"
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,50.44,53.989999999999995,turns out to be very important for boositng because in the
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,53.99,57.36,"end, boosting is going to use this trick of distributions in order"
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,57.36,60.22,to define what hardest is. Since we are going to have learning
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,60.22,62.839999999999996,algorithms that do a pretty god job of learning on a bunch
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,62.84,66.15,of examples. We're going to pass along to them a distribution
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,66.15,69.43,"over the examples, which is another way of saying, which examples are"
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,69.43,72.35000000000001,"important to learn, versus which examples are not as important to"
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,72.35,75.91999999999999,learn. And that's where the hardest notion is going to come in.
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,75.92,78.37,"So, every time we see a bunch of examples, we're"
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,78.37,80.67,going to try to make the harder ones more important to get
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,80.67,83.09,right. Than the ones that we already know how to solve.
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,83.09,85.55,"And I'll, I'll describe in a minute exactly how that's done."
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,85.55,87.63,>> But isn't it the case that this distribution
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,87.63,89.75,doesn't really matter? You should just get them all right.
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,89.75,91.3,>> Sure. But now it's a question of
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,91.3,93.05,how you're going to get them all right. Which
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,93.05,95.58,brings me to my second definition I want to
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,95.58,101.12,make. And that second definition is a weak learner.
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,101.12,103.84,"So there's this idea of a learning algorithm, which is"
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,103.84,106.94,what we mean by a learner here. As being weak. And
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,106.94,109.2,that definition's actually fairly straightforward
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,109.2,110.5,so straightforward in fact that you
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,110.5,113.07,can sort of forget that it's really important. And all a
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,113.07,116.50999999999999,"weak learners is, is a learner that no matter what"
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,116.51,120.25,"the distribution is over your data, will do better than chance"
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,120.25,122.77,when it tries to learn labels on that data. So what
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,122.77,126.11999999999999,does does better than chance actually mean? Well what it means
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,126.12,128.979,"is, that no matter what the distribution over the"
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,128.979,132.32000000000002,"data is, you're always going to have an error rate that's"
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,132.32,134.73999999999998,less than a half. So that means sort of
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,134.74,137.58,"as a formalism, is written down here below. That for"
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,137.58,140.04000000000002,"all D, that is to say no matter what"
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,140.04,144.26,"the distribution is, your learning algorithm We'll have an expected"
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,144.26,147.47,error. That is the probability that it will disagree with
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,147.47,151.56,it through actual concept if you draw a single sample
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,151.56,153.36,that is less than or equal to one half
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,153.36,156.07000000000002,minus Epsilon. Now epsilon is a term that you end
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,156.07,159.29,up seeing a lot in mathematical proofs and particularly ones
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,159.29,162.51999999999998,"involving machine learning. And epsilon just means a really, really"
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,162.52,167.02,small number somewhere between a little bigger than 0 and
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,167.02,170.24,"certainly much smaller than 1. So, here what this means"
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,170.24,173.98000000000002,technically is that you're bounded away from 1 1/2. Which
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,173.98,176.56,another way of thinking about that is you always get
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,176.56,178.24,some information from the learner. The
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,178.24,180.83,learner's always able to learn something. Chance
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,180.83,183.79000000000002,would be the case where your probability is 1/2 and you actually learn
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,183.79,186.95999999999998,nothing at all which kind of ties us back into the notion of information
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,186.96,190.70000000000002,gained way back when with decision trees. So does that all make sense Michael?
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,190.7,194.17999999999998,">> I'm not sure that I get this right. Let's, maybe we can do"
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,194.18,197.91,a quiz and just kind of nail down some of the questions that I've got.
6lhp_YSGhEA,Ensemble Boosting Quiz Two Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,197.91,199.82,">> Okay, sure. You got an idea for a quiz?"

zUXJb1hdU0k,Weak Learning Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,25.56,27.11,hypotheses. Got it?
zUXJb1hdU0k,Weak Learning Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,27.11,27.58,>> Got it.
zUXJb1hdU0k,Weak Learning Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,27.58,33.099999999999994,">> Okay, your entire instance space consists entirely of"

zUXJb1hdU0k,Weak Learning Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,54.29,59.42,"example. So, in this case hypothesis one gets examples 2, 3,"

zUXJb1hdU0k,Weak Learning Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,63.1,66.16,"three gets one in four correct, but two and three incorrect."
zUXJb1hdU0k,Weak Learning Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,66.16,69.32,">> I see. So, there's no hypothesis that gets everything right."
zUXJb1hdU0k,Weak Learning Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,69.32,70.05,>> Right.
zUXJb1hdU0k,Weak Learning Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,70.05,72.00999999999999,>> So does that mean that we don't have a weak

lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,18.89,19.900000000000002,>> Mm-hm.
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,19.9,23.43,">> Then hypothesis one, H1 gets three"
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,23.43,25.37,"out of four correct, that's three quarters."
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,25.37,27.26,That's better than a half. So.
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,27.26,27.540000000000003,>> Well done.
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,27.54,31.919999999999998,">> Then I fill that in, in the good boxes, quarters all the way down."

lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,44.42,45.9,">> You'd think, anyone, do you think anyone listening to"
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,45.9,47.73,this is old enough to get turtles all the way down.
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,47.73,49.86,">> Yeah, that's a great joke. Everybody knows that joke."
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,49.86,50.37,>> And

lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,53.36,57.1,you should go look up turtles all the way down. And then come back. Okay.
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,57.1,59.53,">> It's a, it's a really great joke if you're computer scientist."
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,59.53,60.97,">> Yes, and if you don't think it's a good"

lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,63.22,63.26,>> [LAUGH]
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,63.26,64.67999999999999,>> What about the evil distribution?
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,64.68,66.33000000000001,">> So then I started to generate. Okay, well what"
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,66.33,69.55,"if, the, the, the issue here is that, because we spread"
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,69.55,73.07,"all the, the, the, the probability out in the first hypothesis"
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,73.07,75.52,"really good. So I said okay, well let me put all"
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,75.52,77.95,the weight on the first example. The x1.
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,77.95,79.43,>> Okay. So what did that look like.
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,79.43,82.4,">> Now h1 did very badly. It gets, it's 100 percent error. And"
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,82.4,86.80000000000001,h2 is 100 percent error. But h3 is 0 percent errors. So so.
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,86.8,86.89,>> yes.
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,86.89,89.05,">> So, so putting it all putting all the weight on x1 is no"
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,89.05,92.64,"good. And if you look x2, x3, x4, they all have the property that there's"
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,92.64,94.75,always a hypothesis that gets them right.
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,94.75,95.96,"So I started to think, well maybe there"
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,95.96,100.69999999999999,isn't an evil distribution. And I kind of lucked into putting a half on both
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,100.7,103.27,"the first and the second one. because i figured that, that"
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,103.27,106.08,"ought to work, but then i realized, oh wait a second that's"
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,106.08,110.57,"an evil distribution, because if you choose h1, h2, or h3,"
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,110.57,115.58,they all have exactly 50% error on the half a half distribution.
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,115.58,121.7,">> Very good. So 1/2, 1/2, zero, zero, is a correct answer."
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,121.7,125.83500000000001,">> Now I don't know if there's others. You know, certainly X, putting all"
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,125.835,129.185,"the weight on X2 and X3 is no good, because H2 and H1"
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,129.185,132.29,both get those. Putting all the weight on X3 and X4 are no
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,132.29,136.0,"good, because H1 gets all of those correct. In fact we have to"
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,136.0,139.42,"have some weight on X1, right. Otherwise H1 is the way to go."
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,139.42,143.29,">> Right. So, yeah. No, that's interesting."
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,143.29,144.9,So what does that mean in this case?
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,144.9,146.20000000000002,">> What do you mean, what does that mean?"
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,146.2,147.92,">> So what does this tell us about, how"
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,147.92,150.01999999999998,do we build a weak learner for this example?
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,150.02,150.89000000000001,>> So what it
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,150.89,152.26,tells us is that since there is a
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,152.26,155.25,distribution for which none of these hypotheses will
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,155.25,157.31,"be better than chance, there is no weak"
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,157.31,160.917,"learner for this hypothesis space, on this instant set."
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,160.917,162.51,>> Interesting. Now is there a way that
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,162.51,164.85999999999999,"we can, like, okay, so this example has no"
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,164.86,166.57000000000002,weak learner. Is there a way to change
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,166.57,168.47,this example so it would have a weak learner?
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,168.47,170.53,>> Um...I'm sure there is.
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,170.53,175.32,">> Like if we change that x2, x, h3, if that was a check instead of an X."
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,175.32,177.218,>> Which one?
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,177.218,179.512,X2 H3.
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,179.512,181.84,">> So if we made that a green one, here I'll,"
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,181.84,184.53,I'll make it a green one. By using the power of computers.
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,184.53,186.13,">> Woah, special effect."
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,186.13,186.76999999999998,>> Yes.
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,186.77,188.89000000000001,>> So now there's no way to put weight
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,188.89,191.77999999999997,on any two things and have it fail. I don't
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,191.78,193.89000000000001,"know, my intuition now is that this, this should have"
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,193.89,196.76,"a weak learner. Okay, well, how would we prove that?"
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,196.76,199.29,">> I don't know, but may be we should end this quiz."
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,199.29,202.35999999999999,">> Yeah, I think, we should end this quiz. And leave it as an exercise"
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,202.36,206.02,to the listener. I'm pretty sure I can figure this out.
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,206.02,207.63000000000002,"By the way, we should point a couple of things here"
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,207.63,210.963,"though, Michael. That one is that, the if it weren't the"
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,210.963,215.72,"case, if we had more hypotheses and more examples. Perhaps an odd"
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,215.72,218.07,number of them and we have the x's and the y's
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,218.07,220.6,in the right places then there'd be lots of ways to
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,220.6,224.72,get weak learners for all the distributions just because you'd have
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,224.72,227.39,more choices to choose from. What made this one particularly hard is
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,227.39,230.08999999999997,that you only had three hypotheses and none of
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,230.09,232.89000000000001,"them was, not all of them were particularly good."
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,232.89,234.92,">> Sure, yeah. I mean if you have a bun-, you can have many,"
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,234.92,236.85999999999999,many hypotheses and they're all pretty bad
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,236.86,238.32000000000002,then you're not going to do very well.
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,238.32,240.03,">> Well, it would depend upon if"
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,240.03,241.83,they're bad on very different things. But you're
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,241.83,245.75,"right, if you have a whole lot of hypotheses that are bad at everything, you're"
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,245.75,248.68,going to have a very hard time with a weak learner. And if you have a
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,248.68,250.14000000000001,whole bunch of hypotheses that are good at
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,250.14,252.39999999999998,"almost everything, then it's pretty easy to have"
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,252.4,252.85,a weak learner.
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,252.85,254.7,">> Interesting. Okay, this is more subtle"
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,254.7,256.579,"than I thought. So that's, that's interesting."
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,256.579,258.32,>> Right. So what the lesson you should take away
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,258.32,261.209,"from this is. If you were just, to think about it"
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,261.209,263.34,for 2 seconds you might think okay weak learner. That
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,263.34,266.9,"seems easy. And often it is, but if you think about"
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,266.9,269.59999999999997,for 4 seconds you realize that's actually a pretty strong
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,269.6,272.75,condition. You're going to have to have a lot of hypotheses that
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,272.75,274.43,"are, many of which are going to have to do good on"
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,274.43,277.52,"lots of different examples, or otherwise, you're not always going to be"
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,277.52,279.32,able to find one that does well no matter what the
lj-IO4uuVR8,Weak Learning Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,279.32,283.42,"distribution is. So it's actually a fairly strong, and important condition."
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.19,3.55,"All right Michael, so here's boosting in pseudo code. Okay,"
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,3.55,5.18,let me read it out to you then you can tell
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,5.18,8.48,me if it makes sense. So we're given a training set.
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,8.48,11.72,"It's made up of a bunch of xi, yr pairs. You"
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,11.72,15.18,"know, x is your input and y is your output."
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,15.18,18.35,And for reasons that'll be clear in a moment All of
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,18.35,22.340000000000003,your labels are either minus one or plus one. Where minus
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,22.34,25.24,one means not in class or plus one means you're in
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,25.24,28.259999999999998,a class. So this is a binary classification task. That make sense?
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,28.26,29.360000000000003,>> So far.
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,29.36,32.14,">> Okay. And then what you're going to do is,"
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,32.14,34.545,"you're going to loop at every time step, let's call it"
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,34.545,39.18,"lower-case t. From the first time step one, to some big"
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,39.18,41.29,time in the future. We'll just call it capital T and
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,41.29,42.98,not worry about where it comes from right now. The
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,42.98,46.239999999999995,first thing you're going to do is you're going to construct a distribution.
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,46.24,47.84,"And I'll tell you how in a minute, Michael. Okay, so,"
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,47.84,50.260000000000005,"so, don't worry about it. And we'll just call that D"
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,50.26,52.47,"sub T. So, this is your distribution over your"
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,52.47,57.22,"examples at some particular time T. Given that distribution, I"
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,57.22,59.35,want you to find a weak classifier. I want your
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,59.35,63.43,weak learner to output some hypothesis. Let's call that epsilon
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,63.43,65.45,sub T. The hypothesis that gets produced to that
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,65.45,69.56,time step. And that hypothesis should have some small error.
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,69.56,71.75,"Let's call that error Epsilon sub T, because it's a"
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,71.75,75.31,small number. Such that it does well on the training
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,75.31,79.0,"set, given the particular distribution. So, I'm just rewriting"
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,79.0,82.06,"my notion of error from, the other side of the"
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,82.06,84.75,screen. So there are times we want you to find
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,84.75,87.19,"a weak classifier. That is, we want you to call"
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,87.19,90.31,some weak learner that returns some hypothesis. let's call
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,90.31,93.14,it h sub t that has a small error. let's
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,93.14,96.87,call that epsilons of t. Which is to say that
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,96.87,100.39,the probability of it being wrong that is disagreeing with
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,100.39,104.67,"the training label is small, with respect to the underlying distribution."
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,104.67,108.23,">> So just to be clear there, the epsilon could"
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,108.23,111.56,be as big as slightly less than a half. Right? It
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,111.56,114.2,"doesn't have to be teeny, tiny. It could actually be,"
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,114.2,116.10000000000001,almost a half. But it can't be bigger than a half.
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,116.1,118.86999999999999,">> That's right. And, and no matter what happens."
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,118.87,121.48,"Or even equal to a half. but, you know,"
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,121.48,123.39,"we can assume, although it doesn't matter for the"
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,123.39,125.54,algorithm that the learner is going to return the best one
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,125.54,128.12,"that it can. With some error. But regardless, it's"
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,128.12,131.05,"going to have, it's going to satisfy the requirements"
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,131.05,134.04000000000002,"of a weak learner, and all I've done is"
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,134.04,136.31,copy this notion of error over to here. Ok?
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,137.37,138.5,>> Awesome!
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,138.5,141.32,">> Ok. So, you're going to do that and you'll do that a whole bunch of times"
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,141.32,145.315,"steps, constantly finding hypothesis at each time step"
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,145.315,151.06,"h sub t with small error epsilon sub t constantly making new distributions,"
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,151.06,153.02,"and then eventually, you're going to output some"
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,153.02,155.93,"final hypothesis. Which, I haven't told you yet how"
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,155.93,157.75,you're going to to get the final hypothesis. But that's
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,157.75,159.77,"the high level bit. Look at your training data,"
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,159.77,164.11,"construct distributions, find a week classifier with low error."
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,164.11,165.93,Keep doing that you have a bunch of them
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,165.93,168.49,and then combine them somehow into some final hypothesis.
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,168.49,171.25,"And that's high level of algorithm for boosting, okay?"
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,171.25,173.38,">> Okay, but you've left out the two, two really"
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,173.38,175.88,"important things, even the part from how you find we,"
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,175.88,178.43,"weak classifier, which is where do we get this"
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,178.43,181.38,"distribution and where do we get this, this final hypothesis?"
ooxQS5-Grgc,Boosting In Code - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,181.38,183.64,">> Right, so let me do that for you right now."
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.45,2.5300000000000002,"Okay Michael, you've called my bluff. You, you said"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,2.53,4.43,"I've left out the most important parts, and you"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,4.43,8.02,"are right. So, I'm going to tell you ,how to"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,8.02,11.399999999999999,"construct the most important parts. Let's start, with the distribution."
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,11.4,14.24,"So, let's start with the base case, and that"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,14.24,17.55,"is the distribution, at the beginning of time, D"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,17.55,20.94,"sub one. So, this distribution, is going to be"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,20.94,26.339000000000002,"over each of the examples and those examples, are ,indexed,"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,26.339,28.86,"so, over i. And I'm simply going to"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,28.86,32.49,"set that distribution, to be uniform. So, how"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,32.49,34.42,"many examples do we have, Michael? Let's pick,"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,34.42,36.2,let's pick a letter. Let's call it n.
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,36.2,36.38,>> Okay.
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,36.38,38.72,">> Why not, cause we do that for everything else and I'm"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,38.72,43.23,going to say that for every single one of the examples they happen one
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,43.23,46.949999999999996,"over int times, that is uniform distribution. Now, why do I do that,"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,46.95,51.480000000000004,"because, I have no reason to believe, for the purposes of this algorithm,"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,51.48,54.94,"that any given example, is better ,than any other example,"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,54.94,57.599999999999994,"more important than any other example, harder than other example"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,57.6,60.03,"or anything else. I know nothing. So, see if you"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,60.03,62.24,can learn over all of the examples. You with me?
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,62.24,63.68,">> Yeah, cause I feel like if it"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,63.68,66.092,"actually solves that problem, we're just done. So [CROSSTALK]"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,66.092,68.89,">> [CROSSTALK] Yes and, and that's what you always want. But that's"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,68.89,71.55,"the easy case. So I start out with uniform distribution, that's what you"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,71.55,74.05,"usually do ,when you don't know anything. But, what are you going to"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,74.05,76.53,"do ,while your in the middle? So, here's what I am going to"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,76.53,79.6,"do Michael. At every time step T, I'm"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,79.6,82.50999999999999,"going to construct, a new distribution, Dis of"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,82.51,85.25,"T plus 1. Okay so, here's how we're"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,85.25,88.61,going to construct the distribution at every time step. Okay?
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,88.61,93.925,"I'm going to create the new distribution, T plus 1 to be E for each example, I."
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,93.925,101.66,"- to be the old distribution, and times T, times E to the minus alpha T, times Y"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,101.66,105.97999999999999,"sub i, times H of sub T, of X of I, all divided"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,105.98,109.605,by Z sub T. [LAUGH] So that's pretty obvious right? [LAUGH]
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,109.605,111.85000000000001,"So what do each of those terms mean? I mean ,I"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,111.85,115.55,"know it's intuitively obvious ,even to the most casual observer, but ,let"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,115.55,118.00999999999999,me just try to explain what each of the parts mean.
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,118.01,120.97,"So, we know that the D is our distribution and it's some"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,120.97,124.22,"number, where, over all the examples, it adds up to one."
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,124.22,126.66,"And it's a stand-in, we know, because I said this at the"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,126.66,129.88,"beginning, for how important a particular ,example is, how"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,129.88,131.74,often we expect to see it. And that's the
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,131.74,134.16,"trick that we're using with distributions. So, I'm going to"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,134.16,137.42,"take the old distribution for an example, of, for"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,137.42,140.0,a particular example. And I'm going to either make
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,140.0,144.84,"it bigger or smaller, based upon, how well, the"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,144.84,149.57,"current hypothesis, does, on that particular example. So, there's"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,149.57,151.76999999999998,"a cute little trick here, we know that h"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,151.77,155.98000000000002,"of t always returns, a value ,of either minus one or"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,155.98,161.19,"plus one, because ,that's how we define our training set, you"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,161.19,163.48,"always have a label of minus one or plus one. So,"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,163.48,165.64,ht is going to return minus one or plus one for a
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,165.64,168.73999999999998,particular x sub i. Y of i which is the label
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,168.74,171.74,"with respect to that example, is also always going to be plus"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,171.74,174.86,"one or minus one. And alpha t is a constant, which"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,174.86,176.78,I will get into a little bit later just right now think
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,176.78,179.301,of it as a number. And so what
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,179.301,183.30599999999998,"happens, Michael, if the hypothesis, at time t for"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,183.306,186.59900000000002,"a particular example x of i agrees, with the"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,186.599,190.76999999999998,"label, that is associated with that x of i?"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,190.77,192.20000000000002,">> Well, hang on, you say the alpha's a"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,192.2,195.10999999999999,number. Is it a positive number? A between 0
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,195.11,196.66000000000003,and 1 number? A negative number? What kind of
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,196.66,198.38,"number? Does, does it not matter. I think it matters."
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,198.38,199.5,">> That's a good question. It, it"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,199.5,201.83,"matters eventually. But right now, that number is"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,201.83,203.53,"always, positive."
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,203.53,205.23,">> Positive, alright. So, like, a [UNKNOWN]. Almost"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,205.23,206.91,"like a learning rate-y kind of thing, maybe."
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,206.91,208.43,">> It's a learning rate-y kind of thing, sort of."
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,208.43,214.13,">> Alright, so, good. So the y, okay, I see, I see. So, the y"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,214.13,219.66,"times the h is going to be. 1 if they agree, and minus 1 if they disagree."
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,219.66,224.02,">> Exactly, so if they both say positive 1, positive 1 times positive 1 is 1."
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,224.02,227.89000000000001,"If they both say negative 1, negative 1 times negative 1 is 1. So, it's exactly"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,227.89,229.97,"what you say when they agree, that number is 1. And"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,229.97,234.07,"when they disagree, that number is minus 1. Alpha Sub T,"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,234.07,238.10999999999999,"which i define below, is always a positive number. You can"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,238.11,240.35000000000002,trust me on this. The error is always between 0 and
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,240.35,242.84,1. And it just turns out that the natural log of
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,242.84,245.67000000000002,"1 minus a number between 0 and 1 over that number,"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,245.67,249.44,always gives you a positive number. And if you don't believe
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,249.44,252.63,"me, you should play around with the numbers till you convince yourself."
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,252.63,255.51,"So, that's going to be some positive number."
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,255.51,258.57,"So, that means when they agree, that whole product"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,258.57,261.65999999999997,"will be positive. Which means, you'll be raising"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,261.66,266.0,e to minus some number when they disagree that
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,266.0,268.02,product will be negative which means you'll be
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,268.02,271.83,"raising e to some positive number. So, let's imagine"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,271.83,274.0,they agree. So you're going to be re
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,274.0,277.66,"raising, e, to minus some number, what's going to"
iWfmROeYu24,The Most Important Parts - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,277.66,281.38000000000005,happen to the relative weight of d sub t of i?
MpFjG3bAGwk,When D agrees Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.67,2.4,"So, Michael wants us to do a quiz."
MpFjG3bAGwk,When D agrees Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,3.63,5.83,Because Michael likes quizzes cause he thinks you like
MpFjG3bAGwk,When D agrees Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,5.83,8.01,"quizzes. And so, I want you to answer"
MpFjG3bAGwk,When D agrees Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,8.01,10.79,this question before Michael gets a chance to. So
MpFjG3bAGwk,When D agrees Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,10.79,16.149,just to be clear here's the question again. What happens to the distribution
MpFjG3bAGwk,When D agrees Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,16.149,21.380000000000003,over a particular example i when the hypothesis ht that was output by the
MpFjG3bAGwk,When D agrees Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,21.38,26.7,"example. Agrees with the particular label, Y-sub-i."
MpFjG3bAGwk,When D agrees Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,26.7,29.15,"Okay, so we have four possibilities when they agree."
MpFjG3bAGwk,When D agrees Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,29.15,33.07,One is the probability of you seeing that particular
MpFjG3bAGwk,When D agrees Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,33.07,36.065,"example increases. That is, you increase the value of"
MpFjG3bAGwk,When D agrees Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,36.065,38.73,D-sub-t on i. Or the probability of you seeing that
MpFjG3bAGwk,When D agrees Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,38.73,42.949999999999996,"example decreases. That is, the number d of t"
MpFjG3bAGwk,When D agrees Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,42.95,45.64,"of i goes down, or it stays the same"
MpFjG3bAGwk,When D agrees Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,45.64,49.38,when they agree or well it depends on exactly
MpFjG3bAGwk,When D agrees Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,49.38,52.190000000000005,what's going on with the old value of d and
MpFjG3bAGwk,When D agrees Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,52.19,54.87,"alpha and all these other things. So ,you can't"
MpFjG3bAGwk,When D agrees Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,54.87,57.23,really give just one of those other three answers.
MpFjG3bAGwk,When D agrees Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,57.23,59.474,So those are your possibilites. The other radio buttons
MpFjG3bAGwk,When D agrees Quiz - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,59.474,62.47,[LAUGH] only one of them is right. And go.
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.17,1.26,Okay Michael what's the answer.
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,1.26,3.12,">> Alright, so you kind of were walking us through"
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,3.12,8.690000000000001,"it, but basically if Yi and Ht agree, that means"
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,8.69,10.59,they're both negative or they're both positive. They're equal
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,10.59,12.45,to each other. So when we multiply them together we
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,12.45,16.16,"get one. One times whatever our alpha thing is,"
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,16.16,18.78,some positive number is going to be positive. We're negating
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,18.78,21.5,"that, so it's negative E to the negative something is"
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,21.5,25.78,"something between zero and one. Less than, less than one."
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,25.78,28.87,"So, that's going to scale it down. So, it looks"
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,28.87,31.400000000000002,like. And you know assuming that everything else goes ok
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,31.4,34.96,"with, with the way that ,uh, the normalization happens right?"
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,34.96,37.58,It seems like it could be depends on the normalization.
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,37.58,42.8,">> So by the way. That's a good point. The the x sub t. Is in fact, what ever"
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,42.8,46.23,"normalization constant you need at time T, in order"
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,46.23,47.55,to make it all work out to be a distribution.
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,47.55,51.269999999999996,">> Correct. Then not going to, not going to change."
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,51.27,51.870000000000005,>> True.
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,51.87,54.25,">> But is some of them are correct and some of them incorrect, the ones"
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,54.25,56.53,that are correct are going to decrease. And the
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,56.53,57.95,ones that are incorrect are going to increase.
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,58.97,61.1,">> That's right, so what's the answer to the quiz."
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,61.1,61.88,>> Depends.
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,61.88,64.78,">> That's true, it does. That's exactly the right answer."
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,64.78,68.48,"It depends ,on what else is going on, you're correct. Now."
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,68.48,69.55,>> But I feel like it should
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,69.55,72.47,"be decreases, like that's really, mainly what happens."
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,72.47,76.81,">> That's also fair. The answer is, if this one is correct,"
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,76.81,80.22,"that is they agree, and you disagree on at least some of"
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,80.22,84.9,"them, at least one, one other example, it will in fact decrease."
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,84.9,88.31,"So I could ask a similar question, which is, well what happens"
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,88.31,93.21000000000001,when they disagree? And at least one other example agrees. Then what happens?
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,93.21,96.02,">> Yeah, then they, then that should increase. Oh."
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,96.02,96.6,>> Right.
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,96.6,99.63,>> Oh. It's going to put more weight on the ones that it's getting wrong.
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,99.63,101.83999999999999,>> Exactly. And the ones that it's getting
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,101.84,105.69,wrong must be the ones that are harder. Or at least that's the underlying
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,105.69,107.64999999999999,"idea. All right, Michael, so you got"
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,107.65,109.99000000000001,it? So you understand what the equation's for?
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,109.99,113.1,">> Yeah, it look. It seemed really scary at first but it seems you know"
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,113.1,115.69999999999999,marginally less scary now because all that it's
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,115.7,118.8,"doing, it's doing it in a particular way."
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,118.8,121.31,I don't know why it's doing it in this particular way. But all it seems to
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,121.31,127.01,"be doing is. The answers that it, it had, it was getting wrong... It puts more"
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,127.01,128.18,weight on those and the ones that its
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,128.18,129.8,"getting right, it puts less weight on those"
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,129.8,131.88000000000002,"and then you know, the loop goes around"
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,131.88,133.45,again and it tries to make a new classifier.
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,133.45,137.6,">> Right, and since the ones that its getting wrong are getting more and"
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,137.6,141.82,more weight but we are guaranteed or atleast we've assumed that we have a weak
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,141.82,143.9,learner that will always do better than
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,143.9,148.20000000000002,"chance. On ,ah, any distribution, it means that"
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,148.2,152.48999999999998,you'll always be able to output some learner that can get some of the ones
nle0iezRpoo,When D agrees Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,152.49,154.08,"that you were getting wrong, right."
xzqnQQSTEAk,Final Hypothesis - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,0.08,3.25,"So that ties together this, what constructed E does"
xzqnQQSTEAk,Final Hypothesis - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,3.25,6.92,"for you, and connecting it to the hardest examples."
xzqnQQSTEAk,Final Hypothesis - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,6.92,8.8,"So now, that gets us to a nice little"
xzqnQQSTEAk,Final Hypothesis - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,8.8,11.98,trick where we can talk about how we actually output
xzqnQQSTEAk,Final Hypothesis - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,11.98,15.65,"our final example. So, the way you construct your"
xzqnQQSTEAk,Final Hypothesis - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,15.65,17.93,"final example, they way you do that combination in the"
xzqnQQSTEAk,Final Hypothesis - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,17.93,20.92,step is basically by doing a weighted average. And
xzqnQQSTEAk,Final Hypothesis - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,20.92,25.330000000000002,the weight Is going to be based upon this alpha
xzqnQQSTEAk,Final Hypothesis - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,25.33,34.37,sub T. So the final hypothesis is just the s g n function of the weighted sum of
xzqnQQSTEAk,Final Hypothesis - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,34.37,38.75,"all of the rules of thumb, all of the weak classifiers that you've been picking"
xzqnQQSTEAk,Final Hypothesis - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,38.75,40.99,up over all of these time steps Where
xzqnQQSTEAk,Final Hypothesis - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,40.99,44.230000000000004,"they're weighted by the alpha sub T's. And remember,"
xzqnQQSTEAk,Final Hypothesis - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,44.23,50.54,the alpha sub T is one half of the natural log of one minus epsilon T over
xzqnQQSTEAk,Final Hypothesis - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,50.54,54.25,"epsilon T. That is to say, it's a measure of how"
xzqnQQSTEAk,Final Hypothesis - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,54.25,58.24,"well you're doing with respect to underlining error. So, you get more"
xzqnQQSTEAk,Final Hypothesis - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,58.24,61.67,weight if you do well Then if you do less well or
xzqnQQSTEAk,Final Hypothesis - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,61.67,64.01,you get less weight. So what does this look like to you?
xzqnQQSTEAk,Final Hypothesis - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,64.01,66.68,Well its a weighted average based on how well you're doing or
xzqnQQSTEAk,Final Hypothesis - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,66.68,69.87,how well each of the individual hypotheses are doing and then you
xzqnQQSTEAk,Final Hypothesis - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,69.87,72.77000000000001,pass it through a thresh holding function where if its below zero
xzqnQQSTEAk,Final Hypothesis - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,72.77,75.6,you say you know what? Negative and if its above zero you
xzqnQQSTEAk,Final Hypothesis - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,75.6,78.38,say you know what? Positive and if its zero you just throw
xzqnQQSTEAk,Final Hypothesis - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,78.38,81.86,"up your hands and And return zero. In other words, you return literally"
xzqnQQSTEAk,Final Hypothesis - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,81.86,85.75,"the sign of the number. So you are throwing away information there, and"
xzqnQQSTEAk,Final Hypothesis - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,85.75,88.71,"I'm not going to tell you what it is now, but when we go"
xzqnQQSTEAk,Final Hypothesis - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,88.71,91.27999999999999,to the next lesson it;s going to turn out that that little bit of
xzqnQQSTEAk,Final Hypothesis - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,91.28,92.64,information you throw away is actually
xzqnQQSTEAk,Final Hypothesis - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,92.64,94.21,pretty important. But that's just a little
xzqnQQSTEAk,Final Hypothesis - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,94.21,97.36999999999999,"bit of a teaser. We'll get back to that there. Okay so, this"

xzqnQQSTEAk,Final Hypothesis - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,120.87,123.2,>> Well there's two answers. The first answer
xzqnQQSTEAk,Final Hypothesis - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,123.2,126.18,is. You use natural logs because you're using
xzqnQQSTEAk,Final Hypothesis - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,126.18,128.21,exponentials and that's always a cute thing to
xzqnQQSTEAk,Final Hypothesis - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,128.21,130.6,"do. And of course, you're using the error term"
xzqnQQSTEAk,Final Hypothesis - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,130.6,132.4,as a way of measuring how good the hypothesis

u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,17.19,21.32,">> Okay. So, let's go through an example. So, here's a very simple"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,21.32,24.47,"example. So, I got three little boxes on the screen. Can you see them?"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,24.47,25.24,>> Yeah.
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,25.24,25.959999999999997,">> Now,"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,25.96,28.89,they're the same boxes. I've drawn them up here beforehand
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,28.89,32.99,because I'm going to solve this problem in only three steps.
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,32.99,34.28,">> Hey those boxes are really nice, did"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,34.28,36.25,you get help from our trusty course developer?
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,36.25,38.6,>> I did in fact did get help from our trusty
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,38.6,41.36,"course developer. And when I say help, I mean he did this."
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,41.36,42.35,>> Oh thanks Push Car.
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,42.35,44.65,>> Yes Push Car is wonderful. Now what's
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,44.65,46.769999999999996,really cool about this is that Push Car is
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,46.77,47.970000000000006,already let you know that we're going to be
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,47.97,51.31,able to do this in 3 simple steps. And
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,51.31,53.57,I'm going to be able to animate it. Or at least hopefully
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,53.57,56.66,"it'll look animated by the time, [LAUGH] we're done with all"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,56.66,59.97,the editing. So just pay attention to the first box for
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,59.97,64.48,"now, you have a bunch of data points; red pluses and"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,64.48,67.144,"green minuses, which is the opposite of what we usually do"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,67.144,69.935,Push Car. But either way it's red pluses and green minuses.
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,69.935,73.62,"[LAUGH] With the appropriate labels and they all live in this,"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,73.62,76.4,"this part of the plane. By the way, what do you call"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,76.4,78.05000000000001,a part of the plane? I know you have
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,78.05,80.72,"line segments, what's like, a sub part of a plane?"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,80.72,82.32,>> Looks like a square to me.
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,82.32,84.46,">> Yes it is, but I mean, what do you call them? You,"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,84.46,87.14999999999999,"you don't call it a plane segment, do you? What do you call it?"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,87.15,87.85000000000001,>> A region.
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,87.85,92.53999999999999,">> A square region, fine. So it's a square region on a plane. And we"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,92.54,97.13000000000001,"want to figure out how to be able to correctly classify these examples. Okay, so"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,97.13,98.92999999999999,that is nothing new there. We just want to be able to come up with
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,98.93,101.46000000000001,something. So now we have to do what we did like in the quiz is that
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,101.46,104.94,we have to specify what our hypothesis space is. So
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,104.94,109.12,here's our hypothesis space. So the hypothesis space is the set
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,111.46,114.53999999999999,Of axis aligned semi-planes. You know what that means?
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,114.54,116.57000000000001,">> Mm, no."
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,116.57,118.99,">> Well for the purpose of this example it means,"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,118.99,123.47,"I'm going to draw a line, either horizontal or vertical and say"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,123.47,127.2,that everything on one side of that line is positive
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,127.2,129.36,and everything on the other side of that line is negative.
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,129.36,130.4,">> I see. Okay, good."
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,130.4,132.63,>> Right. And their axes align because it's only
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,132.63,136.67,"horizontal and vertical, and they're semi-planes because the positive part"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,136.67,140.76,"of it is only in part of the plane. Okay, so I'm"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,140.76,145.17,going to just walk through what boosting would end up doing with this particular
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,145.17,149.30999999999997,example or what a boosting might do with this particular example given that
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,149.31,155.05,you have a learner. That always chooses between axis aligned semi planes. Okay?
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,155.05,156.69,>> Yeah.
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,156.69,159.44,>> So let's imagine we ran our boosting algorithm
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,159.44,162.87,now in the beginning it's step 1 all of the
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,162.87,166.29,examples look the same because we have no particular reason
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,166.29,168.35,"to say any are more important than the other, any"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,168.35,170.91,are easier or harder than the other. And that's just
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,170.91,173.7,the algorithm we had before We run through and we ask
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,173.7,178.14999999999998,our learner to return some hypotheses that does well in
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,178.15,182.07,"classifying the examples. It turns out that though there are many,"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,182.07,183.81,and in fact there are an infinite number of possible
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,183.81,188.17000000000002,hypotheses you could return. One that works really well is one
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,188.17,190.67999999999998,that looks like a vertical line that separates
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,190.68,192.96,the first two data points from the rest.
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,192.96,193.87,>> That is what I was guessing.
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,193.87,198.31,>> Of course it was. And what I'm saying here is that everythign to
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,198.31,201.47,the left of this line is going to be positive and everything to the right
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,201.47,206.91,is going to be negative. So if you look at this what does this hypothesis do? So
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,206.91,211.98,"it gets correct, correctly labeled positive. The two pluses to the left. Right?"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,211.98,212.86999999999998,>> Correct.
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,214.28,217.14000000000001,>> And it gets correct all of the minuses as well.
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,217.14,217.92,>> Correct.
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,217.92,222.57999999999998,>> Right? But it gets wrong the three pluses on the
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,222.58,226.16000000000003,"right side. So it gets, this wrong, this wrong, and this wrong."
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,226.16,227.77,">> Right, the Three Plusketeers."
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,227.77,232.04000000000002,>> Exactly. [LAUGH] The Three Plusketeers. That's
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,232.04,235.32,actually pretty good. So I'm just you know
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,235.32,239.95999999999998,I'm just going to ask you to trust me here but it turns out that the specific
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,239.96,247.37,"error here is 0.3 and if you stick that into our little alpha you end up,"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,247.37,251.73000000000002,"our little, our little formula for alpha, you end up with alpha equal to 4.2."
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,251.73,252.92999999999998,>> That's not obvious to me but.
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,252.93,255.76000000000002,">> Is is See, see, see it's not always obvious."
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,255.76,255.875,>> [LAUGH]
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,255.875,257.92,>> Okay. Good. So there you go and that's
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,257.92,260.22,just what happens when you stick this particular set in
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,260.22,263.39000000000004,there. So now we're going to construct the next distribution.
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,263.39,265.63,Right? And what's going to happen in the next distribution?
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,265.63,268.95,>> So the one's that it got right should get less weight and the one's that
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,268.95,270.67,it got wrong should get more weight so
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,270.67,273.79,those three plusketeers should become more prominent somehow.
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,273.79,277.64000000000004,">> That's exactly what happens. They become, I'm just going to draw them"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,277.64,282.58,as much thicker and bigger to kind of emphasise that they're getting
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,282.58,286.19,"bigger, and it's going to turn out that everything else is going"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,286.19,290.75,to get smaller which is a lot harder to draw here. So i'm
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,290.75,292.44,just going to kind of leave them their
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,292.44,295.46,"size, so they sort of get normalized away. Okay?"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,295.46,299.15999999999997,>> I would guess as to what the next plane should be. I think that we should
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,299.16,303.62,cut it. Underneath those pluses but above the green
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,303.62,307.03000000000003,minuses. And that should get us three errors. The
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,307.03,309.14,two pluses on the left and the minus on
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,309.14,311.13,the top will be wrong. But they have less
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,311.13,312.92,"weight than the three pluses we got right, so"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,312.92,314.35,this going to be better than the previous one.
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,314.35,315.98,">> So,"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,315.98,320.11,that's possibly true. But it's not what the learner output.
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,320.11,320.51,>> Oh!
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,320.51,323.39,>> Let me tell you what the learner did output though. This learner
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,323.39,328.09,"output by putting a line to the right of the three pluses, because"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,328.09,332.65999999999997,he's gotta get those right in saying that everything to the left is
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,332.66,335.76000000000005,"in fact, positive. So, does that seem like a reasonable one to you?"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,335.76,338.84999999999997,">> Well, it does better than half. I guess that's really all what we're"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,338.85,341.57000000000005,"trying to do, but it does seem to do worse than what I suggested."
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,341.57,344.7,">> Well, let's see, it gets the three"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,344.7,347.65,"that mattered that you were really, really doing poorly"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,347.65,351.46999999999997,"right but then so did yours. And it only,"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,351.47,354.29,and it picks up still the other two which
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,354.29,357.57,it was getting right. And it gets wrong these
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,357.57,360.55,three minus' which aren't worth so much. So is
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,360.55,362.7,"that worse than what you suggested? No, it gets"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,362.7,366.816,"wrong, oh, the three minuses. Oh, it gets correct"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,366.816,370.01,those two red pluses on the left. So it gets three things
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,370.01,372.65,"wrong. So that's just as good as what I suggested. Okay, I agree."
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,372.65,376.10999999999996,">> Okay good. So the error of this step by the way, turns out"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,376.11,381.53000000000003,to be 0.21 and the alpha at this time step turns out to be 0.65.
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,381.53,386.34999999999997,"So that's pretty interesting, so we got a bunch of these right and a bunch of"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,386.35,392.27000000000004,these wrong. So what's going to happen to the distribution over these examples.
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,392.27,393.65,">> Alright, the ones that it, again, the"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,393.65,396.28,ones that it got wrong should get pushed up
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,396.28,398.09999999999997,"in weight and which ones are those, those are"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,398.1,401.3,"the, the three green minuses in the middle patch"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,401.3,401.71000000000004,>> Right.
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,401.71,405.06,">> They should become more prominent. The pluses, the three, the three"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,405.06,408.7,plusketeers should become less prominent than they were but it still might be
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,408.7,412.28999999999996,more prominent than they were in the beginning. And maybe because in fact
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,412.29,417.27000000000004,"the alpha, let's see the alpha is bigger so, it will have actually"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,417.27,419.9,a bigger effect on bringing it down.
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,419.9,421.48999999999995,">> Yeah I guess so, but it, there'll still be"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,421.49,424.37,more prominent than the other ones that haven't been bumped.
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,424.37,426.63,">> Yeah the ones that you, the, the two, the two"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,426.63,429.51,"red pluses on the left have, you've never gotten them wrong."
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,429.51,429.8,>> Hm.
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,429.8,433.0,">> So they're really going to disappear. So, if we do, If I"

u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,435.27,439.53999999999996,"that you're still, you're going to have. These pluses are going to be a"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,439.54,442.29,"little bit bigger than the other pluses, but they're going to be smaller than"

u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,446.07,449.96,going to be bigger than they were before. But those two pluses
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,449.96,452.97999999999996,"are going to be even smaller, and these two minuses are going to"
u1MXf5N3wYU,Three Little Boxes - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,452.98,457.13,"be smaller. So, what do you think the third hypothesis should be."

zodDmURwMHY,Which Hypothesis Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,39.49,43.690000000000005,of interesting. So if you look at this third hypothesis

zodDmURwMHY,Which Hypothesis Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,100.36,101.59,>> And the fact that we're doing a weighted

zodDmURwMHY,Which Hypothesis Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,103.64,106.06,>> Yeah. And it should remind you of one other thing.
zodDmURwMHY,Which Hypothesis Quiz Solution - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,106.06,107.67,>> I'm imagining that you want me to say

OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,7.26,9.27,and then we can start to wrap up. Okay.

OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,20.1,25.61,"only, you know, does pretty things with axis of line semi-planes, but also"
OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,25.61,29.21,that it will converge to good answers and that it will
OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,29.21,33.39,"find good combined hypotheses. You know, we could go look at"
OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,33.39,36.11,the reading and write down a proof that shows that boosting
OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,36.11,38.891999999999996,does well. Umm. And there's one in the reading. Or we
OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,38.892,41.38,could talk about an intuition. So if someone were to come
OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,41.38,44.172000000000004,up to you. If a student were to find you somewhere
OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,44.172,47.592,"and said, I read the proof, I'm kind of getting it,"
OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,47.592,50.632,but do you have a good sort of intuition about why
OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,50.632,54.449999999999996,boosting tends will do well? What do you think you would tell them?
OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,54.45,57.24,Could you think of something simple? I've been struggling with this for a while.
OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,57.24,59.400000000000006,>> No. [LAUGH].
OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,59.4,61.87,">> Okay, well, then let me try something on you and you can tell"
OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,61.87,65.074,"me if it sort of makes sense. So this is just an intuition for why,"
OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,65.074,70.0,"for why boosting pins will do well. Okay, so what does boosting do? Okay."
OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,70.0,73.09,"Boosting basically says, if I have some"
OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,73.09,75.99000000000001,examples that I haven't been able to classify
OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,75.99,81.21,"well, I'm going to re-rate all my examples. So that the ones"
OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,81.21,83.02999999999999,I don't do well become increasingly
OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,83.03,85.16,"important. Right, that's what boosting does. Yes?"
OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,85.16,85.47999999999999,>> Yes.
OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,85.48,90.965,">> Right, that's what this whole, whole bit of D is all about. It's all about"
OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,90.965,96.56,re-weighting based on difficulty and hardest. And we know that
OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,96.56,101.04,we have the notion of a weak learner. That no matter what happens for
OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,101.04,105.16000000000001,"whatever distribution, we're always going to be able to find"
OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,105.16,108.28,"some hypothesis that does well. So, if I'm trying to"
OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,108.28,111.98,"understand why boosting in the end, why the final hypothesis"
OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,111.98,114.62,"that I get at the end, is going to do well."
OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,114.62,116.33,I can try to get a feeling for that by
OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,116.33,120.25,"asking, well. Under what circumstances would it not do well? So,"
OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,120.25,122.99,"if it doesn't do well, then that means there has"
OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,122.99,127.16999999999999,"to be a bunch of examples that it's getting wrong, right?"
OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,127.17,127.83,>> Mm hm.
OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,127.83,129.8,">> That's what it would mean not to do well, agreed?"
OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,129.8,130.288,>> Yeah.
OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,130.288,136.67000000000002,>> Okay. So how many things could it not get right? How many things could it

OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,139.64,141.77999999999997,"Well, I'm going to argue Michael, that, that"
OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,141.78,145.78,number has to be small. There cannot be a lot of examples that it gets wrong.
OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,145.78,147.92,So do you want to know why? Do you want to know my reasoning for why?
OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,147.92,149.17,>> Yeah.
OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,149.17,152.39999999999998,">> So, here's my reasoning, let's imagine I had a"

OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,155.23,158.14999999999998,I've done it T times. I've gone through this many times

OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,167.08,171.17000000000002,"since I have a distribution and I re-normalize, and it has"
OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,171.17,174.88,"to be the case that at least half of the time,"

OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,182.72,185.0,"had a whole bunch of them wrong. Well, then I would"
OWjjAP4noUE,Good Answers - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,185.0,189.68,naturally renormalize them with a distribution so that all of those things

1AIZsPOhgmE,Summary - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,96.55,97.06,>> Hm.
1AIZsPOhgmE,Summary - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,97.06,99.73,>> So I think that's important. It's agnostic.
1AIZsPOhgmE,Summary - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,99.73,101.68,>> Meaning you can plug in any learner you want?
1AIZsPOhgmE,Summary - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,101.68,104.9,>> Yeah. So long as it's a weak learner. So there's something
1AIZsPOhgmE,Summary - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,104.9,107.72,we learned about. We learned about weak learners that we defined with that
1AIZsPOhgmE,Summary - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,107.72,113.03,"meant. And, we also talked about ,um, what error really, really means."
1AIZsPOhgmE,Summary - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,113.03,116.95,With respect to some kind of underlying distribution. What do you think Michael?
1AIZsPOhgmE,Summary - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,116.95,118.24000000000001,>> That seems like useful stuff.
1AIZsPOhgmE,Summary - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,118.24,120.64999999999999,>> These are useful stuff to me. I'm going to throw one more
1AIZsPOhgmE,Summary - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,120.65,122.92,"thing at you, Michael, before I let you go. Okay, you ready?"
1AIZsPOhgmE,Summary - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,122.92,123.85000000000001,>> Yep.
1AIZsPOhgmE,Summary - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,123.85,126.82,>> Here's a simple fact. About boosting that
1AIZsPOhgmE,Summary - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,126.82,128.91,turns out in practice. You know our
1AIZsPOhgmE,Summary - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,128.91,131.62,favorite little over-fitting example. Do you know
1AIZsPOhgmE,Summary - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,131.62,134.42000000000002,how over-fitting works? You have a training
1AIZsPOhgmE,Summary - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,134.42,136.47,"line that tends to get better, and better,"
1AIZsPOhgmE,Summary - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,136.47,141.18,and better. Maybe even going down to zero error. But then you have test
1AIZsPOhgmE,Summary - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,141.18,145.26000000000002,error Which gets better and better and at some point it starts to get worse.
1AIZsPOhgmE,Summary - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,145.26,146.57999999999998,>> Mm.
1AIZsPOhgmE,Summary - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,146.58,149.32000000000002,">> And at that point you have over fitting and I think,"
1AIZsPOhgmE,Summary - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,149.32,152.325,"Michael, you asserted it at some point or maybe I asserted that"
1AIZsPOhgmE,Summary - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,152.325,154.98,",you always have to worry about over fitting. Over fitting is"
1AIZsPOhgmE,Summary - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,154.98,156.63,just the kind of fact of life. You got to come
1AIZsPOhgmE,Summary - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,156.63,158.75,up with ways to deal with it or sort of over
1AIZsPOhgmE,Summary - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,158.75,162.38,"believing your data. Well, what if I told you that in practice"
1AIZsPOhgmE,Summary - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,162.38,165.62,"When you run boosting, even as you run it over time"
1AIZsPOhgmE,Summary - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,165.62,169.13,so that your training error keeps getting better and better and
1AIZsPOhgmE,Summary - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,169.13,172.96,"better and better, it also turns out that your testing error"
1AIZsPOhgmE,Summary - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,172.96,177.28,keeps getting better and better and better and better and better and
1AIZsPOhgmE,Summary - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,177.28,178.25,better and better.
1AIZsPOhgmE,Summary - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,178.25,180.24,>> That seems too good to be true.
1AIZsPOhgmE,Summary - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,180.24,183.49,>> It does seem too good to be true. It turns out it's
1AIZsPOhgmE,Summary - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,183.49,187.02,not too good to be true. And I have an explanation for it.
1AIZsPOhgmE,Summary - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,187.02,187.83,>> Tell me.
1AIZsPOhgmE,Summary - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,187.83,190.20000000000002,>> Not until next time.
1AIZsPOhgmE,Summary - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,190.2,191.64999999999998,">> alright, see you then."
1AIZsPOhgmE,Summary - Georgia Tech - Machine Learning,191.65,192.99,>> See you then. Bye.
